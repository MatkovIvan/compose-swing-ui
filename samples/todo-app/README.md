# todo-app sample

A small to-do application built with Compose Swing UI. It shows the Compose-over-Swing shape: a thin
Swing `main` that hands a `JFrame` to `setContent`, and a reactive composable tree that knows nothing
about frames or look-and-feels.

## Run

```bash
./gradlew :samples:todo-app:run
```
