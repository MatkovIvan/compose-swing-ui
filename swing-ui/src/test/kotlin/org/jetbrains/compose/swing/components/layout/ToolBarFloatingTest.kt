/**
 * [ToolBar]'s `floating` is two-way: it puts the bar into a window of its own or brings it back, and
 * `onFloatingChange` reports what the bar did that the caller did not ask for - a declaration the bar
 * could not take, and a bar the user dragged out or docked themselves. A declaration the bar takes is
 * not reported back, since the caller already holds it.
 *
 * Floating needs a window to open the bar's own beside, so the refusal is measured off-screen and every
 * case that really floats realizes a frame, and therefore skips on a headless environment. A refusal is
 * not the end of the declaration behind it: a bar moved into a window takes the one that stood while it
 * had none.
