/**
 * What a container driven by a [MeasurePolicy] offers the policy, and what survives between the Swing
 * calls that drive it: constraints compared by value, the extents a caller may name and the ones
 * refused, one object that is both the child's [Measurable] and the [Placeable] its measure hands back,
 * what a child is and is not asked, what a pass a parent ran leaves behind for the placement that
 * follows, and a placement that is absolute unless the policy asks for the container's reading order to
 * mirror it.
 *
 * These cases build their containers by hand rather than declaring them, and the frame [peered] grants
 * a peer is what a reading kept between two passes turns on - the tree a composed test mounts has none.
