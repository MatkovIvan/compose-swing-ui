/**
 * Display-independent coverage that a `Dialog`'s content composes WITHIN a `Window`-owned composition
 * and that state flows from the window scope into the nested dialog content.
 *
 * Realizing a real `Window`/`JDialog` peer needs a display; the display-gated window and dialog tests
 * cover that path. This test does not realize on-screen peers, so it runs with or without a display.
 * It models the wiring `Window`/`Dialog` use: the harness composition plays the
 * window-owned scope, the dialog's content is mounted into a DETACHED host container (standing in for
 * a `JDialog` content pane that is not part of the window's Swing tree) as a CHILD of the captured
 * window-scope [androidx.compose.runtime.CompositionContext] via
 * [setContentAsInteropHost]. Because the host is detached, an upward tree-walk from it finds nothing;
 * only the explicit parent context joins the two compositions.
 *
 * The observable contract: a value provided and a state owned in the window scope reach the detached
 * dialog content and recompose it when the window-scope state changes — proving the nesting, not a
 * coincidental independent root that would see only CompositionLocal defaults.
