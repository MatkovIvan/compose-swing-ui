/**
 * A row or column measures a child once and reuses that measurement until its container is invalidated -
 * the contract [LinearLayout.invalidateLayout] exists for.
 *
 * Each case drives a realized frame, because that is the only place the measurements are held. AWT
 * carries a child's invalidation up to its container only while `isValid` reports true of it, and that
 * requires a peer. On an unrealized container the manager measures afresh every pass and holds nothing.
