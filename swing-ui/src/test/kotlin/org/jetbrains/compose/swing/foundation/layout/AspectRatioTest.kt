/**
 * A child declaring an aspect ratio is sized to the widest or tallest size its constraints allow at that
 * ratio - from the width they allow first, or from the height first where it asks for that - and is
 * measured under the constraints it was offered where none of those extents names a size at that ratio.
 * A ratio that is not finite and greater than zero names no size and is refused where it is declared.
 *
 * Ported from androidx `foundation-layout`'s own `AspectRatioTest`, whose names the cases here keep so the
 * two files read side by side. Most of the sizes that test names are taken under constraints no container
 * this library ships hands a child - a least width with no greatest one, a width bounded while the height
 * is not - so a case that measures builds its container by hand and hands the child the constraints
 * outright, the way that test's own `getSize` builds a layout of its own.
 *
 * The ratio a composition declares reaches its child only through what the applier tells the box holding
 * it, which a hand-built container says nothing about; that is
 * [aRatioIsMeasuredThroughWhereTheChildIsComposed].
 *
 * That test's `testAspectRatioModifier_intrinsicDimensions` is not here. It asks for one extent while
 * fixing the other, and `java.awt.LayoutManager2` asks a container what it prefers, the least it can
 * occupy and the most it may, never a width for a given height; [IntrinsicTest] says the same of the
 * questions this tree does ask. What that case asks with neither extent fixed - the ratio reporting the
 * content's own size - is [aRatioNoSizeSatisfiesLeavesTheChildMeasuredUnderWhatItWasOffered].
