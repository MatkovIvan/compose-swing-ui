/**
 * A menu on screen follows the state its items read, and that includes its size: a realized popup keeps
 * the bounds it was shown with until it is packed again, so an item added while the menu is open would
 * be clipped without the pack that ends each menu pass.
 *
 * The popup here travels the real show path - [JPopupMenu.show] over an invoker in a real window -
 * rather than the presentation seam the other popup-menu cases capture through, because the defect is
 * in the size of a popup the toolkit has realized. An open popup is closed by the toolkit when its
 * window is deactivated, which is why this class needs the window system's undivided attention.
