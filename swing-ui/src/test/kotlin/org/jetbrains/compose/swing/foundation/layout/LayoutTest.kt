 * A container written as a [MeasurePolicy] rather than as a layout manager. The policy is asked the
 * same questions [Row], [Column] and [Box] are: an extent to name when nothing constrains it, and an
 * extent plus a placement when its container has one.
 *
 * A child inside it is an ordinary child - it declares its own layout modifiers and its own constraint
 * to the policy, and a container nested under it is asked a constrained question like any other.
