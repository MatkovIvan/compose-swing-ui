/**
 * Behavioural tests asserting that a [Dialog] leaving the composition fully releases its realized
 * [JDialog].
 *
 * A visibility change is applied on a fresh event-dispatch tick (a modal show blocks inside a nested
 * event loop, so it can never run inline in an effect), so a dialog can leave the composition while a
 * show it requested is still pending on the event queue. Setting `isVisible` on a disposed window
 * realizes a fresh peer, which would resurrect the dialog with no content, no listeners, and no way
 * to close it from the application; a pending show must therefore settle as a no-op once the dialog
 * has left the composition. The dialog is composed modeless so showing it never blocks the driving
 * thread. Skipped in headless environments where no real peer can be realized.
 *
 * The interleaving under test — two recompositions landing on one event-dispatch turn, ahead of the
 * deferred show that the first of them queued — requires recomposition to be driven synchronously.
 * The shared harness advances recomposition through queued event-dispatch turns, which lets every
 * already-queued runnable (including the deferred show) run between frames, so this test drives a
 * minimal immediate-dispatch recomposer of its own.
