/**
 * Which apply pass a [ToolBar] settles its declared `floating` state in.
 *
 * One pass: the pass that declares a floating bar is the pass that moves it into a window of its own,
 * and the pass that declares one no bar can take is the pass that hands the caller the docked state it
 * settled for. A bar hangs nowhere while its own update block runs, so the state is settled at the end of
 * the change pass instead - the point at which the bar already stands in the container that declared it,
 * and so has a window to open its own beside.
