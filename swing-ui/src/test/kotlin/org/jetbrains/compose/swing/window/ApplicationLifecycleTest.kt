/**
 * Behavioral coverage for the application lifecycle entry points, which run entirely on a Compose
 * recomposer over a non-visual [ApplicationScope] composition and so are exercisable headless without
 * any real window.
 *
 * The visual entry points that realize AWT peers ([Window], [Dialog], [Tray]) are NOT covered here:
 * each constructs a real `JFrame` / `JDialog` / system-tray peer that throws `HeadlessException` (or
 * is unsupported) under the suite's enforced `-Djava.awt.headless=true`. The application loop itself,
 * however, needs no peer — it spins a recomposer on the EDT — so its start/exit contract is asserted
 * by observable effects: the suspending entry point returns once the scope requests exit, and the
 * scope-bound coroutine variant completes its job.
