/**
 * Behavioral tests for the window every content composition reads as its [LocalWindow]: content mounted
 * into a window reads that window without anyone stating it, whether the content is set on the window, on
 * a container that reaches one later, on a menu bar that is installed on one afterwards, or on a
 * container inside a window the composition itself realized - and whichever content composition of that
 * window it is. Content composed away from any window keeps reading the window it was composed under.
 *
 * A window a composition declares is a window of its own, so content in it reads the peer it is in
 * rather than the window the declaration was composed under - which for a dialog declared in a window's
 * content is the frame behind it.
 *
 * Every case realizes a real top-level peer, so each skips (reports SKIPPED) on a headless
 * environment. Frames the test owns are packed rather than shown - that realizes the peer without
 * flashing a window on screen - and disposed on every exit path so no peer leaks; a declared window is
 * realized unshown and lives and dies with the composition that declares it. Content is driven by the
 * window's own real Swing frame-clock timer; the test body runs on the EDT and yields it back between
 * checks, letting that timer fire, until a bounded deadline.
