/**
 * Behavioral tests for the per-window recomposer resolution model.
 *
 * Nothing here attaches to a real top-level [java.awt.Window], so these tests run with or without a
 * display; they exercise the *resolution mechanism* the window path is built on, which is fully
 * observable off-screen:
 *  - a window publishes ONE [Recomposer] as the [COMPOSITION_KEY] context on a [JComponent] ancestor
 *    of its content (its root pane), and
 *  - every island under that ancestor resolves to it via the self-first
 *    [findParentCompositionContext] walk.
 *
 * So a single ancestor stamped with one recomposer stands in for a window root pane, and two sibling
 * islands beneath it model two in-window islands. Driven on a controllable [BroadcastFrameClock] (no
 * sleeps, bounded frames).
