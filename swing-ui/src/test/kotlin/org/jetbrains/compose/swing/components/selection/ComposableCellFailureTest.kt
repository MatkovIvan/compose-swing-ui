 * What a composable cell body that throws costs. A cell is composed synchronously, inside the paint or
 * layout pass that asked for it, so the failure is reported to whoever stamped - and to nobody else. The
 * window goes on composing: the cell composition is a child of the window's recomposer, and a failure
 * carried into it would end recomposition for everything the window holds. The cell composition itself
 * stays usable.
