/**
 * When the child-index-space walk answers for a child that moved from one region of its host to another:
 * on the turn of the event queue after the pass that moved it, never on the pass itself.
 *
 * The test drives the frames, so the whole move lands in a single apply pass and the walk has one
 * settled state to answer for. That is what the wait buys: while the pass runs the child names its new
 * region and stands in neither, a state the composition allows and the walk would refuse. A divergence
 * that outlives the pass is refused, and the tree the refusal names is the one the pass finished leaving.
 *
 * That the move really is one pass is stated rather than assumed: the sides a split pane holds read the
 * same whether one pass carried the move or three did, and a move split across passes would give the walk
 * a torn-down state to answer for.
