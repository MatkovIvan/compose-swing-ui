/**
 * Behavioral tests for the window a [Dialog] names as its owner: the named window owns the dialog
 * whichever window the dialog happens to be composed in, a dialog naming none takes the window it is
 * composed in, a recomposition naming another window re-owns the dialog, and the owner is the window a
 * [WindowPosition.CenteredOnOwner] position resolves against.
 *
 * A dialog takes its owner at construction, so a change of owner releases the dialog peer and builds a
 * replacement; the cases that change one assert on the peer the window query resolves afresh rather
 * than on the handle they started with.
 *
 * Realizing a dialog realizes the window that owns it, so every window the test names is released once
 * its assertions are done, keeping it out of the set of realized windows the other cases query.
 *
 * A dialog and its owner are realized peers, so these are skipped in headless environments.
