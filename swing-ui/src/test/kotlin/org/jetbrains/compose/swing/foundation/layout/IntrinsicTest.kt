/**
 * A container is asked two argument-less questions - what it prefers, and the least it can occupy - and
 * both run its measure policy rather than its layout pass. The policy writes one body; which of the two
 * is being asked decides only which extent a child that cannot answer a constrained question answers
 * with.
 *
 * This stands in for androidx `foundation-layout`'s own `IntrinsicTest`. Every case there measures
 * through `IntrinsicSize.Min` or `IntrinsicSize.Max` as a modifier, or asks for one axis while fixing
 * the other, and neither reaches a Swing widget: `getPreferredSize()` and `getMinimumSize()` take no
 * argument, a cross-axis extent threaded down would be discarded at the first widget, and every chain
 * ends at one. The cases here pin the questions this tree does ask, and which of the policy's two
 * entry points each of them reaches.
