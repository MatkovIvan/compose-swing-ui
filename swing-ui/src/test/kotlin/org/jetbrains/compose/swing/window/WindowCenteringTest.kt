/**
 * Behavioral tests asserting that a centering [WindowPosition] places a realized peer:
 * [WindowPosition.CenteredOnScreen] centers it on the screen, [WindowPosition.CenteredOnOwner] on the
 * window that owns it, and the resolved placement is written back into the driving state as concrete
 * coordinates.
 *
 * Every peer is composed with an explicit size, so the geometry apply reaches it before it is shown:
 * the placement is computed by AWT alone rather than settling asynchronously behind a native resize.
 * The tests that realize a peer are skipped in headless environments; the string form of the
 * centering positions holds with or without a display.
