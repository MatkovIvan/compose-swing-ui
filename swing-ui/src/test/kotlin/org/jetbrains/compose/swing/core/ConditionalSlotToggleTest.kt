/**
 * A [PanelLayout.Border] panel whose NORTH child is conditional, alongside stable CENTER and SOUTH children. A child
 * appearing or disappearing shifts the composition indices of its siblings, and the applier addresses
 * the AWT component array by that index, so a stable sibling has to come through the toggle as the
 * same component in the same region - both when the conditional child arrives and when it leaves.
 *
 * Keeping the same instance in the same region is not on its own evidence that a sibling was left
 * alone: a host that dropped all three children and re-added the two that survived would end up
 * holding exactly that, and would have reset the depth and the attach order every one of them was
 * given. The churn the applier reports is what tells the two apart.
