/**
 * What `setContent` refuses, and what it must go on accepting.
 *
 * Two things make a call unanswerable rather than merely unusual. A container that already holds a live
 * content composition - composed, or still pending until the container reaches a window - is asked once
 * for the composition its contents nest into, and cannot give two answers. A named parent whose
 * recomposer has ended would never recompose what is composed under it. Both fail on the call.
 *
 * Each case that refuses is paired with the nearest legal call, because a check that fires on a legal
 * transition is worse than the misuse it guards against.
