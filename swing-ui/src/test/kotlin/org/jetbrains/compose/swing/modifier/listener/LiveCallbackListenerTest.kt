/**
 * A callback that changes between passes reaches the built listener without the listener being removed
 * and added again: the callback is not what the registration is made of, and a registration held in a
 * `val` is the same instance every pass.
 *
 * The callback being no part of the registration is also what lets every slot in a chain adopt what the
 * pass declares, so the chain is applied without being diffed - see
 * [org.jetbrains.compose.swing.modifier.ModifierChainSkipTest]. The callback that fires must be the
 * newest one across that skip, and two live callbacks on one chain must each keep their own.
 *
 * A slot is asked for the element declared in its place by position, so the shape a chain is built in -
 * which way its cells nest, what sits between two callbacks - decides which slot is asked for which
 * element. Each of those shapes is pinned here to leave every slot holding the callback its own
 * element declares.
