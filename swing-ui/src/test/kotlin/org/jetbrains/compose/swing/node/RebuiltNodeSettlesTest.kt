/**
 * That a two-way declaration reaches the widget of a node built again after its content parked, for both
 * routes content parks by: a deactivated [ReusableContentHost], and a `movableContentOf` no host emitted
 * for a pass.
 *
 * Content that parks is released for good and the content that comes back is composed afresh, widget
 * included, so the fresh widget opens on whatever its own constructor gives it. What puts the standing
 * declaration back on it is the settle the first pass over a fresh node makes - a declaration unchanged
 * across the park is still a declaration that widget has never been given.
