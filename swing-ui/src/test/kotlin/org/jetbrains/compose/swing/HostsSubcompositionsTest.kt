/**
 * Behavioral coverage for the `hostsSubcompositions = true` opt-in on [SwingNode].
 *
 * The scenario mirrors the real use case: a custom component built via [SwingNode] returns a
 * [java.awt.Container] whose OWN internal logic calls `setContent` on one of its children. That child
 * `setContent` carries no injected recomposer, so it must discover the surrounding composition by
 * walking up the Swing tree to the [SwingNode] component that opted in and stamped its composition
 * context there. We prove the nesting by reading a [androidx.compose.runtime.CompositionLocal] provided
 * at the top of the surrounding composition from inside the child's content, and prove the stamp is
 * cleared once the host node leaves the composition.
