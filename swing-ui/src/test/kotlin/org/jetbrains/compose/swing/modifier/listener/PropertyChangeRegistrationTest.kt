/**
 * The property a listener is bound to names the registration it sits on rather than belonging to the
 * listener, so the same listener named against a different property is a different registration.
 * Keeping the caller's own instance is what makes this worth pinning: by-identity reconciliation sees
 * no change and would leave the listener on the property it was first given. The other direction
 * matters just as much - one name has to mean one registration, or every pass would move the listener off
 * the property it is already on and back.
