/**
 * Behavioral tests asserting which placements of a window reach the driving state.
 *
 * Nobody can drag a window that is not on screen, so a move it takes there is the window system
 * placing it: it resolves a position that names no coordinates, and it leaves declared coordinates
 * standing. A window on screen can be dragged, and there a report of the coordinates a declared
 * reposition superseded is the window system still performing the placement it was busy with rather
 * than a move of the user's, so it leaves the declared coordinates standing too.
 *
 * Every window here declares its size and is never shown, which is what keeps its peer unrealized: a
 * window left to size itself to its content is packed, and packing realizes the peer. Every placement
 * and every notification of one is then the test's own. A realized peer hands its placements to the
 * window system, which performs them and reports back on a schedule of its own, so a report the
 * subject here is meant to answer would be racing reports nobody asked for. A test whose subject
 * needs the window on screen reports it there itself.
 *
 * Skipped in headless environments, where a window cannot be constructed at all.
