/**
 * Behavioral coverage for the lifecycle contract that a [Window], [Dialog], or [Tray] in the
 * composition keeps the enclosing application running. The application loop runs only while its
 * recomposer's effect job has an active child coroutine; a top-level host mounts its content or peer
 * without launching such a coroutine itself, so each host must hold a parked keep-alive effect to
 * remain a reason for the application to stay open until it leaves the composition.
 *
 * Realizing a real top-level peer needs a display, so each case skips on a headless environment; the
 * tray case additionally skips where the platform provides no system tray.
