/**
 * What a pass costs a modifier whose declaration did not change, measured through a user-authored element
 * that counts what the diff asks of it.
 *
 * A modifier is skipped whole when it declares what the one applied last declares; where it does not, the
 * diff walks it and skips each element declaring what its slot already holds. The two skips are counted
 * apart here: the walk through the element's `key`, which the diff asks each element for once when it
 * partitions the modifier chain into slots, and the re-apply through its `update`.
 *
 * A listener callback is read when its event fires rather than written onto its node, so it is not part
 * of what its element declares: a component rebuilding one on every pass - as one built by a helper
 * outside the composition is - leaves its modifier declaring what it declared last, and pays no walk for
 * it. What that callback costs instead, and that the newest one is still what fires, is
 * [org.jetbrains.compose.swing.modifier.listener.LiveCallbackListenerTest].
