/**
 * Behavioral tests for [WindowPosition.CenteredOn], the position that names the window to center on:
 * the declared window is what the placement resolves against on the first pass, a recomposition naming
 * another window re-centers on that one, the placement resolved is written back into the driving state
 * as concrete coordinates, and a window leaving the composition is released while the window it was
 * centered on is left standing.
 *
 * Centering resolves against the bounds the named window holds as the position is applied, so the
 * window named here is realized and shown by the test itself and released once the assertions are done.
 * Every centered peer is composed with an explicit size, so the geometry apply reaches it before it is
 * shown: the placement is computed by AWT alone rather than settling asynchronously behind a native
 * resize.
 *
 * Skipped in headless environments, where there is no window to center on.
