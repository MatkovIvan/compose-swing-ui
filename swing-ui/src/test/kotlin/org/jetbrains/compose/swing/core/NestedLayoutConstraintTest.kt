/**
 * Regression guard for the nested constrained-layout crash.
 *
 * A container [org.jetbrains.compose.swing.SwingNode] reads [BorderLayout]'s region constraint from
 * `LocalSwingConstraint` for its OWN placement when it sits inside a [BorderPanel] region. The defect
 * was that it did not reset that local for its CONTENT, so every child of, say, a [GridBagPanel] placed
 * in the CENTER region also inherited the `"Center"` constraint string. The applier then called
 * `gridBagContainer.add(child, "Center", index)`, and `GridBagLayout.addLayoutComponent` throws
 * `IllegalArgumentException` ("cannot add to layout: constraints must be a GridBagConstraint"). The fix
 * resets `LocalSwingConstraint` to its default for the subtree, exactly like `LocalSlotAttachment`, so
 * each child is placed by the inner panel's own layout manager with the default (null) constraint.
 *
 * Every assertion reads the real AWT tree (parent/child relationships, layout managers,
 * [BorderLayout.getLayoutComponent]); none touches internal bookkeeping.
