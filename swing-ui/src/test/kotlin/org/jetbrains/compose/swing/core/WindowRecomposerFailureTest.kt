/**
 * What a recomposition pass that throws costs a window: its recomposer. The failure is reported to the
 * event dispatch thread's uncaught-exception handler, the content the window held is torn down, and
 * content set afterwards composes on a fresh recomposer and keeps updating.
 *
 * What a failure must leave behind, and what must never be taken for one: a first composition that
 * throws leaves nothing of the composition it ran in standing, its snapshot observer withdrawn from the
 * global apply observers with the rest; a pass that throws part way through a modifier chain leaves
 * every slot that modifier holds standing, so the teardown it provokes runs through; and ending a
 * recomposer is reported to nobody.
 *
 * The cases that need a window realize a real [javax.swing.JFrame], so the window hands out and
 * replaces its recomposer on the production path. A failure is taken by a handler installed on the
 * event dispatch thread for the case's duration, so it is asserted on rather than printed.
