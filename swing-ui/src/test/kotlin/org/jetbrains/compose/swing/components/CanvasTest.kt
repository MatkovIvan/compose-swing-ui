/**
 * Behavioral tests for [Canvas]: repaint is snapshot-observed. We verify that the surface draws once
 * initially, redraws with the new value after a state read *in the composition* recomposes it,
 * automatically requests a repaint when state read *only inside* `onDraw` changes (no recomposition),
 * and stops drawing once removed from the composition.
 *
 * Painting is driven deterministically in the headless harness by forcing a paint pass against an
 * off-screen [BufferedImage] graphics, so every recorded value reflects exactly one [Canvas.onDraw]
 * invocation we triggered. The harness runs the whole test body, painting, and snapshot-change
 * callbacks on the single event dispatch thread.
