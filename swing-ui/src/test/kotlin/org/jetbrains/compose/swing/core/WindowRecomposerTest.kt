/**
 * Behavioral tests for the per-window recomposer on the real-window path: a realized top-level
 * [java.awt.Window] whose islands resolve their composition through
 * [Window.getOrCreateWindowRecomposer]. Unlike the off-screen sharing tests, these tests realize a
 * real [JFrame] so the on-window resolution, memoization, and window-close teardown all run against a
 * live peer.
 *
 * Every case realizes a real top-level peer, so each skips (reports SKIPPED) on a headless
 * environment. Realized frames are disposed on every exit path so no peer leaks. The window
 * recomposer is driven by the window's own real Swing frame-clock timer; the test body runs on the
 * EDT and yields it back between checks, letting that timer fire, until a bounded deadline.
