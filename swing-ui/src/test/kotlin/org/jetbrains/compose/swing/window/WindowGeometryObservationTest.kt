/**
 * Behavioral tests asserting how the geometry a window is declared with reaches its realized peer.
 *
 * A window system reports a drag or a resize once per frame of the gesture, and every report is
 * written back into the very state the window is declared with. The declared geometry therefore
 * reaches the peer by observing that state rather than by recomposing what declared the window: a
 * change reaches the peer with no frame of the composition's, and a report of the user's own gesture
 * costs the composition no recomposition at all.
 *
 * Every window here declares its size and is never shown, which keeps its peer unrealized: the window
 * system then performs no placement and no resize of its own, so every report the composition answers
 * is the one this test made.
 *
 * Skipped in headless environments, where a window cannot be constructed at all.
