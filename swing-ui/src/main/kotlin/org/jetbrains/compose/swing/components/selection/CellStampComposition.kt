/**
 * The rubber stamp a widget's composable cells are painted through - ONE reused component and ONE reused
 * nested [SwingContentComposition], recomposed for every cell the widget asks to paint. This is the model a
 * `ListCellRenderer`, a `TableCellRenderer` and a `TreeCellRenderer` are all built on, and one cell
 * composition serves any of them.
 *
 * The composition joins the enclosing one (via the [parentContext] captured with
 * `rememberCompositionContext`), so [body] sees the surrounding state and
 * [androidx.compose.runtime.CompositionLocal]s; but it is a SEPARATE controlled composition, driven
 * synchronously by [stamp] rather than by the window recomposer's asynchronous frame loop. The cells are
 * display-only stamps: a single reused component tree, never per-cell interactive.
 *
 * The component [body] composes is what the widget is handed: it fills the cell composition's single-view
 * slot, as a `JScrollPane` region does, so nothing of that composition's stands between the component and
 * the cell.
 *
 * @param parentContext the enclosing composition this cell composition joins.
 * @param singleComponentMessage reports a cell body that composes more than one component, in the words
 *   of the widget this cell composition stamps for.
 * @param body the cell body every stamp composes, holding the composition state the stamps write; a
 *   [stamp] whose `hasCell` is `false` composes none of it, which is what leaves the widget the empty
 *   cell - decided once here rather than by each renderer inferring it from the value it stamped.
