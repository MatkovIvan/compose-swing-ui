/**
 * A single line of text standing for a typed value: a number, a date, or input matching a fixed mask.
 * The `JFormattedTextField` renders the value as formatted text and parses what the user types back
 * into a value of that type.
 *
 * The field parses and formats through [formatterFactory], which produces the formatter that maps
 * between the typed [value] and the displayed text (e.g. a `NumberFormatter`, a `DateFormatter`, or a
 * `MaskFormatter` for a fixed mask). With no factory the field falls back to the platform default, which
 * is derived from the class of [value] - the class the field edits in: what it renders, and what a commit
 * is parsed back to. A [value] declared in another class derives that default again, so a field declared
 * an `Int` and later a `Long` commits `Long`s from then on.
 *
 * [value] is the committed, typed value (an `Int`, a `Date`, a `String`, ...); [onValueChange] fires
 * once per value the field commits from an edit, carrying the newly parsed value. Text the user types
 * that does not parse is not committed and produces no callback until it becomes valid. A commit that
 * leaves the value where it was carries nothing new and is not reported. Applying [value] is not itself
 * reported, so a callback that writes [value] back does not loop.
 *
 * This field is strictly controlled: a value the field commits that [onValueChange] does not answer
 * with a matching [value] is settled back onto the declared value on the very next pass, so the field
 * never ends up holding a value the caller has not adopted. A [value] the field has already committed
 * is left alone rather than written again - the characters typed since that commit stay.
 *
 * ```
 * FormattedTextField(
 *     value = amount,
 *     formatterFactory = remember {
 *         DefaultFormatterFactory(NumberFormatter().apply { valueClass = Int::class.javaObjectType })
 *     },
 *     onValueChange = { amount = it as Int },
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * A `NumberFormatter`'s `valueClass` decides the type [onValueChange] receives; set to
 * `Int::class.javaObjectType` here, it is what makes the committed value the `Int` the example casts to.
 *
 * Installing a formatter re-renders the committed value through it, which replaces characters the user
 * has typed but not committed. A [formatterFactory] is installed whenever a different instance is
 * declared, so hold one instance across recompositions (e.g. `remember { ... }`) and supply a new one only
 * where the formatting is meant to change.
 *
 * The text the user is part way through typing need not parse, and while it does not the field holds
 * its previous value: [onEditValidChange] reports that, so a form can mark the field or hold its submit
 * button back. Drive the field with the [FormattedValueState] overload to read that as state instead,
 * and to take a part-typed edit on demand rather than waiting for the field's own focus-lost behavior.
 *
 * @param value the committed, typed value
 * @param onValueChange callback invoked with the parsed value when the field commits an edit;
 *   applying [value] is not itself reported
 * @param modifier the [SwingModifier] applied to the underlying component
 * @param formatterFactory the factory producing the field's formatter, or `null` for the default
 * @param onEditValidChange callback invoked with whether the text now parses, each time that changes;
 *   nothing is reported by default
 * @param focusLostBehavior what to do with a partial edit when the field loses focus (a
 *   [FocusLostBehavior] `JFormattedTextField` constant); `COMMIT_OR_REVERT` by default, which commits
 *   an edit that parses and discards one that does not, restoring the last committed value
 * @param columns the preferred width in columns; `0` by default, sizing to the content
 * @param editable whether the user can type into the field; `true` by default
 * @see FormattedTextField the [FormattedValueState]-driven overload
