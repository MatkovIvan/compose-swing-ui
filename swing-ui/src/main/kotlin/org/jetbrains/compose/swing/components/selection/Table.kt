/**
 * A grid the user reads, sorts, and selects in: a `JTable` reporting the selection, the sort order, and
 * the column layout the user leaves it in.
 *
 * [rows] are the row data; declare each column in [block] with its header, a value extractor, and
 * (optionally) in-place editing. Rows and columns are **data**: changing [rows] or the declared
 * columns rebuilds the table's model on recomposition. Selection is declared with [selectedRowIndices]
 * and reported through [onSelectionChange], expressed as the general multi-select shape so one
 * component covers all of [SelectionMode]'s modes. Place it in a
 * [org.jetbrains.compose.swing.components.layout.ScrollPane] to scroll and to show the column header.
 *
 * ```
 * ScrollPane {
 *     content {
 *         Table(
 *             rows = people,
 *             selectedRowIndices = selection,
 *             onSelectionChange = { selection = it },
 *         ) {
 *             column("Name") { it.name }
 *             column("Age", isEditable = true, onCellEdit = { row, _, v -> update(row, v) }) { it.age }
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * A cell edit commits through the edited column's `onCellEdit`; the displayed value does not change
 * until the caller updates the backing state and the next composition supplies fresh [rows].
 * [onSelectionChange] reports the user's selection changes only, once per settled change - so
 * dragging across rows produces one callback at the end rather than one per row crossed, and
 * rendering new [rows] or new columns produces none. A declared selection is the composition's state and
 * is re-applied on every pass: it survives such a change (an index the current rows no longer cover is
 * dropped), and a user change the caller does not adopt does not stand. Undeclared, the selection is
 * the user's alone - never imposed, and kept across new rows and new columns all the same; where the new
 * rows are too few to hold it, the rows that fall outside them leave the selection and [onSelectionChange]
 * reports what is left of it.
 *
 * A selected row is named by its index into [rows] - the model's own row space, the space
 * [TableColumnLayout.modelIndices] names its columns in - and never by the position it is drawn at:
 * sorting and filtering move where a row is shown and leave the row each index names alone.
 *
 * Sorting is off until [sortable] turns it on, as it is on a bare `JTable`. With it on, clicking a column
 * header sorts the rows by that column, [sortKeys] declares the order they are in and [onSortChange]
 * reports the order a header click leaves them in, and [rowFilter] decides which of them are shown at all.
 * A declared order is the composition's state and is re-applied on every pass, so a header click the caller
 * does not adopt does not stand; undeclared, the order is the user's alone and is never imposed. Each
 * column brings its own `isSortable` and `comparator` to that sorting.
 *
 * The order and the widths of the columns are the same kind of state, declared with [columnLayout] and
 * reported through [onColumnLayoutChange]: dragging a column header sideways reorders the columns and
 * dragging the divider between two headers resizes them, and each reaches [onColumnLayoutChange] with the
 * layout the columns are then in. New columns rebuild the layout from the declarations, so a declared
 * layout is put back over them and survives, and a change the caller does not adopt is reported once and
 * does not stand; an undeclared layout - the user's own - is carried across the rebuild as far as the new
 * columns can hold it, with [onColumnLayoutChange] reporting what is left of it where they cannot. A
 * column's own `minWidth` and `maxWidth` bound every width it can be left at, a drag's as much as a
 * declaration's, and [autoResizeMode] decides how the columns share a width change between them.
 *
 * A column renders its cells through the renderer the table picks by the column's class until its
 * `cellContent` gives it a composable cell of its own. A table gives every one of its rows the same
 * height and never measures one by what its cells ask for, so a cell taller than the text a table sizes
 * its rows for is what [rowHeight] is for.
 *
 * @param rows the row data to display
 * @param modifier the [SwingModifier] applied to the underlying component
 * @param selectedRowIndices the indices into [rows] of the selected rows the caller declares; `null` - the
 *   default - leaves the selection to the user
 * @param onSelectionChange callback invoked with the indices into [rows] the user settles on
 * @param selectionMode how many rows/ranges may be selected; `MULTIPLE_INTERVAL_SELECTION` - the
