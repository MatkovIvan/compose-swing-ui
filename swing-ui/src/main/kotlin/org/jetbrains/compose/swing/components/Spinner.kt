 * A `JSpinner` over numbers: it shows [value] in an editable field beside a pair of arrows that step it

 * the spinner on and the caller does not answer with a matching [value] is settled back onto the
 * declared one, so the spinner shows what the composition holds.
 *
 * A `null` [min] or [max] leaves that side unbounded. Tightening either past the current [value] does
 * not move the value, so the spinner can hold one outside its own range until the next value it takes.
 * A bound is held in [value]'s own class, so bounds and value may be declared in different classes.
 *
 * The class of [value] is the class the field edits in: what it shows, what a commit is parsed back to,
 * and what [onValueChange] is handed. A [value] declared in another class moves the field to that class,
 * so a spinner declared an `Int` and later a `Double` edits decimals from then on.
 *

 * @param onValueChange callback invoked with the value the user changes the spinner to - a step, a

 * @param modifier the [SwingModifier] applied to the underlying component.
 * @param min the smallest selectable value, held in [value]'s class, or `null` for none.
 * @param max the largest selectable value, held in [value]'s class, or `null` for none.
 * @param step the amount a step changes the value by; `1` by default. A step is taken in the class of
 *   the value it steps, so a whole-number step off a decimal value keeps the decimals.
 * @param format the pattern the spinner formats and parses its value with - a `DecimalFormat` pattern;
 *   `null` formats it the way the locale does. A new pattern rebuilds the spinner's own editor around
 *   it.
 * @param editor the editing surface the spinner shows in place of its own, composed into the spinner as
 *   a composition of its own joined to the caller's, so it reads the same state and locals the caller
 *   does; `null` leaves the editor the one the spinner builds for its own model. A fresh lambda each
 *   recomposition is fine - that composition recomposes rather than being rebuilt, so characters typed
 *   but not committed stand.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if both a [format] and an [editor] are declared, if [value] falls
