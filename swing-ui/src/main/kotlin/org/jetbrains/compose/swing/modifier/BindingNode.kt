/**
 * Binds [value] to the component of the node this modifier is applied to, for as long as the element
 * occupies its slot: [attach] runs when the binding is established and [detach] when it ends.
 *
 * The binding follows the modifier node's lifecycle. A different [value] on a later recomposition
 * detaches the previous one before attaching the new, and the node detaching - the component leaving
 * the composition, or parking while deactivated - detaches outright, so a value never keeps driving a
 * component it no longer belongs to. Both callbacks are handed the
 * component the node is attached to, so a value that has since been bound to another component is
 * left driving that one. A `null` [value] declares no binding at all.
 *
 * One binding builder must declare exactly one [attach] callback (call this exactly once per builder):
 * that callback's class is the binding's last-wins slot, so every application of one builder shares a
 * slot while distinct builders stay independent.
 *
 * [target] is the component type the binding requires; [attach] and [detach] receive it already typed,
 * and a component that is not a [target] is rejected at apply with a clear error.
 *
 * Publish the component through `binding` when a caller must reach it - the holder is a handle the
 * caller owns and drives. When the only reader is the component's own composable, have the node act
 * on the component itself instead of publishing it.
