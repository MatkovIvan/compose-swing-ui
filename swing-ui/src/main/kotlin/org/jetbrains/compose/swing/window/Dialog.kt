/**
 * A dialog window, realized as a `JDialog`: it shows [content], holds its geometry in [state], blocks
 * input to the top-level windows in its [modality]'s scope of blocking, and reports the user's attempt
 * to close it to [onCloseRequest].
 *
 * The close gesture is controlled: it invokes [onCloseRequest] and closes nothing, so the dialog stays
 * on screen - and a modal one goes on blocking - until the caller answers, by declaring [visible]
 * `false` or by stopping declaring the dialog at all.
 *
 * The declarative control surface mirrors [Window] (`visible` + `onCloseRequest`, no imperative
 * handle), adding owner resolution and AWT [modality]. The dialog is owned by [owner], which defaults
 * to the nearest enclosing [Window] read from [LocalWindow]. The owner is one of the windows a modal
 * dialog blocks, and the one a [WindowPosition.CenteredOnOwner] position centers the dialog on. A
 * dialog with no [owner] under a bare `application { }` scope, which creates no window, is ownerless:
 * an ownerless document-modal dialog is its own document root, so its scope of blocking is empty and it
 * behaves as a modeless one, while application- and toolkit-modal blocking does not depend on an owner.
 * Centering on the owner then resolves against the screen.
 *
 * The dialog content runs as part of the enclosing (application or window) composition: state from
 * that scope and any [androidx.compose.runtime.CompositionLocal] provided above the dialog flow into
 * [content]. Descendants of the dialog read it as their [LocalWindow]. A shown dialog keeps
 * recomposing while it is visible.
 *
 * [content] receives the dialog as its [WindowScope]: what the dialog carries besides its content - its
 * [MenuBar] - is declared on that scope.
 *
 * The [title], [modality], [visible], [resizable], [alwaysOnTop], [iconImage] and [minimumSize]
 * arguments are reactive: changing any of them in a recomposition updates the realized dialog
 * accordingly. A [modality] change may have no effect on a dialog that is already showing until it is
 * hidden and shown again. Geometry is driven by [state], which is two-way: assigning to
 * [DialogState.position]/[DialogState.size] repositions or resizes the dialog, and a user dragging or
 * resizing the dialog writes the new geometry back into [state].
 *
 * [undecorated] and the owning window are reactive too, at a higher price: a dialog takes its owner at
 * construction and AWT only accepts decorations on a dialog that is not yet realized, so declaring
 * another owner or another decoration releases the dialog peer and builds a replacement. The content is
 * re-hosted in the new peer - its composition, and any state remembered in it, starts over - while the
 * geometry held in [state] and the declared visibility are re-applied to the replacement. A look and
 * feel that draws the dialog decorations itself (see [JDialog.setDefaultLookAndFeelDecorated]) draws
 * them on the replacement too, whatever [undecorated] declares.
 *
 * @param onCloseRequest callback to be called when the user attempts to close the dialog
 * @param state the hoistable, observable geometry (position and size) of the dialog; by default one
 *   this dialog keeps to itself, which leaves the placement to the platform and sizes the dialog to
 *   its content
 * @param owner the window that owns the dialog, or null to take the nearest enclosing [Window] from
 *   [LocalWindow]
 * @param title the title of the dialog, empty by default, matching a freshly constructed `JDialog`
 * @param modality the AWT modality of the dialog, defaulting to [Dialog.ModalityType.MODELESS] (the
 *   JDialog default), which blocks nothing; each other type names its own scope of blocking, which
 *   never covers the dialog's own child hierarchy, and a modality type the toolkit does not support
 *   leaves the dialog modeless
 * @param visible whether the dialog should be visible; `true` by default, so declaring a dialog shows
 *   it, and `false` hides the dialog while keeping its content composed
 * @param resizable whether the dialog can be resized; `true` by default, matching a freshly
 *   constructed `JDialog`
 * @param alwaysOnTop whether the dialog stays above other windows; ignored on platforms that do not
 *   support an always-on-top window, and `false` by default, so the dialog takes its turn in the
 *   platform's stacking order
 * @param iconImage the image shown as the dialog's icon, or null for the platform default; the
 *   windowing system may show it in several places at sizes of its own, or show none at all
 * @param minimumSize the smallest size the dialog can take, or null to leave the floor to the dialog's
 *   layout; a declared size below the floor is raised to it, while holding the user's own resizing to
 *   the floor is platform-dependent
 * @param undecorated whether the dialog is shown without its platform decorations (title bar and
 *   border); `false` by default, so the dialog is shown with them
 * @param content the composable content of the dialog, receiving the dialog as its [WindowScope]
 * @see javax.swing.JDialog
