/**
 * Runs [block] as code the caller supplied, reached from a write of the wrapper's own.
 *
 * Swing hands a listener's exception to whoever provoked the write, and where that is the event pump, the
 * pump reports it and carries on dispatching. Recomposition is this library's pump, but it cannot carry
 * on: a throw reaching it ends the recomposer, and with it every content composition the window holds.
 * So a throw from [block] is reported here instead, at the edge the caller's code sits behind, leaving
 * the write to finish and the composition alive.
 *
 * This is for the places the library reaches the caller's code itself, on the pass that provoked it. Code
 * a widget calls under a gesture Swing dispatched needs none of this: Swing's own pump already reports it
 * and carries on, which is the behavior being matched here.
 *
 * Only code the caller supplied belongs in [block]. What a component requires of a declaration is the
 * library's own to state, and those failures must reach the caller as the failures they are.
 *
 * Every type is contained because what the caller's code throws is theirs to choose: naming a narrower
 * set would leave whichever type went unnamed free to end the composition.
