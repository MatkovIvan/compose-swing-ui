/**
 * Declares a leaf or container Swing node in the composition.
 *
 * This is the primary entry point for defining a **custom component**: wrap any Swing [Component] by
 * passing a [factory] that creates it and an [update] block that maps composition state onto it.
 * Every built-in wrapper (`Button`, `TextField`, `Slider`, …) is built on top of this function — see
 * `docs/CUSTOM-COMPONENTS.md`.
 *
 * A slot-based parent can dictate this node's placement (e.g. a `BorderLayout` region declared
 * through a `BorderPanel` slot) or install it into a host that reaches children through dedicated
 * setters (e.g. a `JScrollPane` region), without the child knowing its container.
 *
 * The node is recyclable: when it is conditionally shown/hidden across recompositions (e.g. a
 * [androidx.compose.runtime.ReusableContentHost] parked and reactivated, or structurally-identical
 * content replacing it in the same slot) the runtime reuses the existing backing [Component] for the
 * new content from a clean baseline rather than allocating a fresh one.
 *
 * When [hostsSubcompositions] is `true`, a `setContent` call on a descendant Swing component joins
 * this composition, sharing its scope and [androidx.compose.runtime.CompositionLocal]s. The component
 * must be a [javax.swing.JComponent] or this throws [IllegalStateException]. Defaults to `false`.
 *
 * @param factory builds the backing Swing component.
 * @param update typed update block; see [SwingNodeUpdater]. Install listeners through the modifier
 *   mechanism — see [org.jetbrains.compose.swing.modifier.listener].
 * @param onRelease optional teardown run when the node leaves the composition for good.
 * @param hostsSubcompositions when `true`, a descendant component's `setContent` joins this
 *   composition. Defaults to `false`.
