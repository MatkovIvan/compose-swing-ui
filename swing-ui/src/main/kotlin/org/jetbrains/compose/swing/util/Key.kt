/**
 * A typed [JComponent] client-property key, read and written through the indexing operators:
 * `component[KEY]` answers what is stored under it, `component[KEY] = value` stores, and assigning
 * `null` clears.
 *
 * Every client property the library owns is declared as one of these. A raw key belongs only to the
 * public `clientProperty` modifier, which carries a key of someone else's - a look-and-feel styling
 * property, say.
 *
 * The type parameter is what the property holds, so a read answers that type and a write takes it, and
 * [name] is what the key shows as - what a component's client-property bag lists it under, and the
 * property name `putClientProperty` fires its `PropertyChangeEvent` with, which a listener bound to a
 * property matches on.
 *
 * A key is also a slot nobody else can reach: a raw string key is collided with by any third-party
 * `putClientProperty` storing under the same string, while a key compares by identity, so the only way
 * to address a slot is the declaration that owns it. Declare a key once, as a top-level `val` - two
 * keys sharing a [name] are two slots.
