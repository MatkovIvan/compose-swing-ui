/**
 * The measure policy behind [Row] and [Column]: it stacks the children along [axis] at their
 * preferred extent, and hands any leftover room to [arrangement] to place instead of the children absorbing it.
 *
 * Weighted children are the exception: they share the leftover extent along the axis in proportion to
 * their weights, and a child with an explicit `maximumSize` takes no more than that allows, leaving the rest empty.
 *
 * Across the axis a child keeps the extent it prefers, capped at the container's, and sits where its
 * declared alignment puts it, or [alignment] when it declared none. A child that declared a cross-axis
 * fill takes the container's whole extent instead, leaving no room for either alignment to place it.
 * Children that declared a baseline alignment are the other exception: they sit so that the baselines
 * their components report fall on one line, and the container holds the deepest baseline above that line
 * and the deepest remainder below it.
 *
 * [arrangement] and [alignment] are the values the current composition declares; the container that
 * owns this manager writes them as they change.
 *
 * One manager lays out the one container it belongs to: a row and a column each build one alongside the
 * panel they create.
