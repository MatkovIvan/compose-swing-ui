 * to arrange; this manager only tells it that a child's constraint has been written again.
 *
 * A child that declared a match of its container's extent is offered the whole inner rectangle in place
 * of the extent it prefers, and is passed over while the container's own extent is worked out - so it
 * takes the size the other children settle rather than adding to it.

 * writes it as it changes.
 *
