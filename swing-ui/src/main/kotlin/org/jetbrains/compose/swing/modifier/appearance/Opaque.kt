 *
 * A look and feel writes this flag from [contentAreaFilled] on every change to that property, so a
 * button holds no flag of its own while the two agree: removing the declaration restores that rule
 * rather than the value read when the declaration attached. A menu item is left out of it - nothing
 * ties its flag to the fill, so what it carries is its own.
 *
 * @param opaque `true` promises the component paints every pixel of its bounds, letting Swing skip what is
 *   behind it; `false` lets the parent show through.
 * @return this modifier with the opaque flag declared on it.
