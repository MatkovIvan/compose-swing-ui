/**
 * Wires one option of a controlled group selection and emits it through [content].
 *
 * The option's composition identity is its position, so the applier installs and uninstalls nodes to
 * match the declarations while each joins and leaves [group] with its membership element. Each listener
 * is installed once for the option's slot and reads the latest [onSelectionChange].
 *
 * The selection moves through the group, so an option can lose it without being touched: the member the
 * group clears raises no action event at all. The mirror therefore follows the button's own item
 * channel, which every member publishes its state on, while the action channel stays what reports the
 * user's pick.
 *
 * One option is the whole of what this wires. Which options there are is the scope contract of the
 * component declaring them, so the component collects them itself and calls this per option.
 *
 * @param group the group shared by every option of the same selection
 * @param index the option's zero-based position, which is what a user selection reports
 * @param modifier the modifier declared for this option
 * @param selected whether this option is the one the composition declares as selected
 * @param onSelectionChange callback invoked with [index] when the user selects this option
 * @param content receives the [SwingModifier] the option's node has to apply - [modifier], the
 *   listener watching the option, and the membership that enrolls the node in [group] - along with the
 *   [MirrorState] its node settles [selected] against

 * Moves this button to [selected] within [group], leaving it alone when it already is.

 * Selecting is a plain write: the group clears the other members itself. Deselecting has to go through
 * the group, because a grouped button refuses `setSelected(false)` - its model asks the group, which
 * only ever moves the selection to another member and never withdraws it - so a controlled selection
 * could not be taken back at all. Clearing the group is safe here because only the member that
 * currently holds the selection ever reaches this branch.
 *
 * A programmatic selection does not fire the button's action listener, so reflecting a controlled
 * index never echoes back as a spurious selection callback.
