/**
 * Marks up [ranges] of a text component with [painter] - the background a search draws behind its
 * matches, the wash behind an error span, the squiggle under a misspelling.
 *
 * The declared ranges are the whole of this modifier's markup: a pass replaces the marks the previous
 * declaration left rather than adding to them, so a range that leaves [ranges] stops being painted and
 * the component ends every pass carrying exactly what was declared. Marks made outside this
 * declaration - the caret's own selection, or another modifier's - are left where they are, and removing
 * the declaration takes only this one's marks away.
 *
 * A range is painted as the span between its two offsets, whichever way round they are, clamped to the
 * document the way a selection is; a range beyond the text paints as far as the text goes.
 *
 * The offsets are the declaration itself, not where a mark starts out: an edit under a mark - the
 * user's typing, or a change to the text the composition declares - leaves the range painted where
 * [ranges] puts it. A span that should move with the edit is declared at its new offsets.
 *
 * The painter is compared by identity, so one built inline is a new painter on every recomposition and
 * repaints the whole set each time; hoist it into a `remember` to repaint only when [ranges] change or
 * the document does.
 *
 * ```
 * TextArea(
 *     state = source,
 *     modifier = SwingModifier.highlights(matches, matchPainter),
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * Requires a [JTextComponent] target.
 *
 * @param ranges the spans to mark, as offsets into the document. They are read as the modifier is built, so a
 *   snapshot list mutated in place invalidates the composition that declared it.
 * @param painter draws every one of the marks; a single painter serves the whole set.
 * @return this modifier with the highlights declared on it.
 * @see javax.swing.text.Highlighter.addHighlight

/**
 * Re-paints a text component's highlighter with the declared ranges whenever the declaration changes,
 * keeping the tags the highlighter handed back so exactly those marks are taken away again. A mark is
 * anchored to positions of the document it was added to, and the document alone decides where those go,
 * so the node listens to the document and paints the declaration again for every change: an edit moves
 * or collapses the positions a mark spans, and a swap - a `JEditorPane` switching content type, a
 * `TextArea` rebinding to a new `DocumentState` - leaves the old tags painting nothing.
 *
 * The [painter] is the caller's own object, handed to the highlighter as the mark's painter, so it is
 * compared by identity: the highlighter tells one painter's marks from another's the same way.
 *
 * [ranges] is a list no caller holds. An equal element leaves the modifier it declares adopted as-is, so
 * what a later declaration is compared against must be a list nothing outside can change under it.
