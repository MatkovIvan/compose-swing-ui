/**
 * Declares one Swing property on the component. The property is read as the declaration arrives and
 * written back when the declaration leaves, so a widget that outlives it carries what it did before.
 * Fold the element in only while a value is declared:
 *
 * ```
 * private fun SwingModifier.declaredDividerSize(dividerSize: Int?): SwingModifier =
 *     if (dividerSize == null) {
 *         this
 *     } else {
 *         property<JSplitPane, Int>(
 *             name = "dividerSize",
 *             value = dividerSize,
 *             read = { it.dividerSize },
 *             write = { pane, value -> pane.dividerSize = value },
 *         )
 *     }
 * ```
 *
 * Declare it in a function of its own, not inline at a call site. The property's slot is the class of
 * the [write] lambda. One `write` written out once gives every widget declaring that property one slot.
 * The same property written through two lambdas is two slots writing over each other, and a `write`
 * that captures anything is a fresh instance each pass, written again rather than adopted. A builder
 * may declare several properties, one `write` each.
 *
 * Declare only a property this library ships no modifier of its own for. Two slots writing one property
 * each take their own record of what it stood at, and the property is put back from the one leaving
 * last.
 *
 * Reach for this where a look and feel writes the property onto the widget itself. Where it only
 * publishes the value under a `UIManager` key and writes nothing onto the widget, read that key and
 * pass the answer as [value]: there is nothing to put back, so no element is needed.
 *
 * @param name the Swing property being written. It labels the property in an error and wherever a tool
 *   shows the modifier; [write] is what identifies the slot.
 * @param value the value to write while this declaration stands.
 * @param read answers with the value the component holds, taken as the declaration arrives.
 * @param write puts a value onto the component. It is called to write [value] and again to put back
 *   what [read] answered, so anything the write must ask for afterwards - a layout pass, a repaint -
 *   belongs inside it.
 * @param restores what the component is held to once this declaration leaves.
 *   [RestorePolicy.EverythingWritten], the default, holds it to carrying [read]'s answer again.
 *   [RestorePolicy.DeclaredPropertyOnly] holds it to [name] alone, for a write a look and feel derives a
 *   property of its own from. [RestorePolicy.None] is for a property the component offers no way to give
 *   back - one whose setter refuses the value [read] answered with, or rebuilds the component's UI - and
 *   [write] says what the component keeps instead.
 * @return this modifier with [name] declared on it.
