/**
 * Ties this modifier's application to [keys]. While they stand the modifier is diffed as usual; a key
 * that does not compare equal to the one applied last takes the whole modifier apart and applies it
 * again from scratch.
 *
 * This is `androidx.compose.runtime.key` for a modifier - the identity of the modifier's application. It
 * is not the slot key an element is matched by ([SwingModifier.NodeElement.key]).
 *
 * Declare it where a look and feel works a property out from a write of yours and has to work it out
 * again: the theme it derives from has changed, while the declarations describing the component have
 * not. Nothing else asks for that. A declaration whose value stands writes the value already there, and
 * Swing announces nothing for a write that changes nothing, so the derivation never runs. A rebuild
 * writes two different values instead - the restore puts back what the modifier found, then the
 * re-application writes the declaration again - and both are announced.
 *
 * A rebuild is a real teardown. Every slot detaches in the reverse of the order the modifier declared
 * them, putting back what it captured, then attaches afresh and captures what it finds by then.
 * Anything a slot binds - a caret, a document, a model, an installed listener - is torn down and built
 * again with it, so transient state those objects hold does not survive.
 *
 * The keys belong to the modifier rather than to a place in it: `SwingModifier.key(t).background(c)` and
 * `SwingModifier.background(c).key(t)` say the same thing. Declaring again adds keys rather than
 * replacing them, so a builder that ties its own writes to a key keeps the one its caller declared:
 * `key(a).key(b)` says what `key(a, b)` does. One declaration repeated counts once, standing where it
 * was declared last.
 *
 * @param keys what this modifier's application is tied to, each compared by `equals`. A key that is a
 *   fresh instance on every pass - a bare `Any()` - rebuilds on every pass.
 * @return this modifier tied to [keys].
