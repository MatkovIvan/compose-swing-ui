 *
 * The write reaches whoever listens to this context on the accessible name or description. A context
 * fires nothing until something asks it to listen, and at the point a declaration attaches there is
 * rarely anything listening yet.
 *
 * A string that was set and reads the same as the derived one survives the write, so it is answered
 * `null`. Putting that `null` back leaves the context deriving, which answers that string only while
 * what it derives from stands.
