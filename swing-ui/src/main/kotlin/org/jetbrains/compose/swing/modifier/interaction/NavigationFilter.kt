/**
 * Installs [filter] on the text component so it decides where the caret lands before every move: an
 * arrow key, a click, and a selection assigned in code all pass through it, and each may be redirected
 * to another offset or left where it is. A `null` filter leaves the caret free to go anywhere in the
 * document.
 *
 * This is [documentFilter] one level up - a document filter gates what the text becomes, a navigation
 * filter gates where the caret may go: the seam for a prompt the caret steps over. Removing the
 * declaration puts back the filter the component carried before.
 *
 * A `JFormattedTextField` is rejected: its navigation filter belongs to its formatter, which returns
 * it from `JFormattedTextField.AbstractFormatter.getNavigationFilter` and reinstalls it whenever the
 * field reformats - a mask's separators are skipped by the mask's own filter.
 *
 * ```
 * TextField(state, modifier = SwingModifier.navigationFilter(SkipThePromptFilter))
 * ```
 *
 * @param filter the [NavigationFilter] to apply, or `null` to leave caret movement unrestricted.
 * @return this modifier with the navigation filter declared on it.
 * @see javax.swing.text.JTextComponent.setNavigationFilter
