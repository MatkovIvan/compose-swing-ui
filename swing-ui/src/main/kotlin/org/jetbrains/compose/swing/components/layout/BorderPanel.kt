/**
 * A composable wrapper for JPanel with BorderLayout, exposing each region as a declarative slot.
 *
 * Declare the regions you need in [block]:
 * ```
 * BorderPanel {
 *     north { Toolbar() }
 *     center { Editor() }
 *     south { StatusBar() }
 * }
 * ```
 * A region hosts exactly one child; redeclaring it replaces the child, and dropping a region (e.g.
 * behind an `if`) removes its child. Omitted regions attach nothing.
 *
 * @param modifier the [SwingModifier] applied to the panel
 * @param hgap the horizontal gap between regions
 * @param vgap the vertical gap between regions
 * @param block declares the regions; see [BorderPanelScope]
