/**
 * What a composition is driven by: a single [Recomposer], the frame clock it recomposes on, and the
 * [CoroutineScope] they run on. Every content composition nested into one of these recomposes on one
 * recomposer and one frame clock.
 *
 * Frame-driven work is cadenced to the display the component this was created for is on, and follows
 * that component across displays: a component reports every [java.awt.GraphicsConfiguration] change,
 * including the ones an ancestor propagates down to it.
 *
 * Content is mounted on it by passing its [compositionContext] as the parent of a mount.
 *
 * It holds a live coroutine scope and a Swing timer, so it has to be [dispose]d. A caller handed one by
 * [create] owns it and decides when it ends; the one a window is given is this library's own and ends
 * itself once nothing composes under it any more.
 *
 * A failure ends it too. The runtime records the first throw and recomposes nothing after it - from a
 * recomposition pass, from content's first composition, or from an effect the content launched - so this
 * is [dispose]d as soon as the runtime reports it stopped. A pass or an effect that throws is reported
 * through the thread's uncaught-exception handler once; a first composition's throw reaches whoever
 * composed it. A pass or an effect reports the stop as it happens.
 * A first composition records the failure without deriving anything, so its stop is reported only on
 * the next change reaching the runtime - a state write, or the settlement an input event queues - and
 * content set in between composes once and is torn down with the rest.
 *
 * Marked [InternalSwingUiApi]; it may change without notice in any release.
