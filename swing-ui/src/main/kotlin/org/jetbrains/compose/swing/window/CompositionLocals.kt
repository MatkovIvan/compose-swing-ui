/**
 * The owning AWT [Window] of the current subtree.
 *
 * Every composition the library roots in a window carries it: the [javax.swing.JFrame] or [javax.swing.JDialog] behind
 * a composed [Window] or [Dialog], and the window a `setContent` content composition is attached to. A composition
 * nested in another inherits the value of the one it joins. The window its own container hangs in answers only where
 * that composition names none, so content composed away from any window (a list cell renderer's rows, a menu shown
 * from a popup) keeps reading the window it was composed under rather than whichever transient peer it is painted
 * into.
 *
 * This is the parent to hand plain Swing API that needs one - `JFileChooser`, `JOptionPane` - and the
 * window to bring to the front or query for its screen.
 *
 * Content given a caller's own composition to compose under, before its container is added anywhere, reads `null`
 * until that container reaches a window. It reads that window from then on, without being composed again.
 *
 * The value is `null` wherever the content stands in no window at all, such as a bare `application { }` scope that
 * has created none.

 * The providable side of [LocalWindow], which stays the library's to state: the owning window is read off
 * the composition or the Swing tree, and a subtree that declared a different one would hand a dialog an
 * owner it does not live under.
 *
 * A composition root provides it computed rather than by value. The computation reads snapshot state, so a window
 * arriving invalidates the places that read the window rather than the provision. That is what lets the local be
 * static: the provision itself does not change while content is on screen.

 *
 * Both locals are inherited first, and answered from where [component] hangs only where that inheritance
 * says nothing. That is what leaves [LocalLifecycleOwner] overridable from outside the library - by a
 * caller, or by a navigation library - since a content composition defers to whatever stands above it.
 *
 * [window] is the window the content composition has settled on, not one resolved while composing, so one
 * that already has a window stands under it from its first pass. It is observable, so a content
 * composition that inherited none reads the window its container reaches once it arrives there.
