/**
 * The declaration order of a stacking container's children, and the component array derived from it.
 *
 * A `Container` holds one array of children, and that array answers three questions at once: a
 * `JComponent` paints from the end of it back to the front, hands a mouse event to the first child the
 * point falls in, and a layout manager walks it by index. So the front of the array is the top of the
 * stack, and a container that sorts the array by a declared z-index can no longer read declaration order
 * off it. This keeps that order, and [restack] arranges the array from it.
 *
 * [container] is the container whose children these are, and [zIndexOf] reads where a child declared it
 * sits - the two containers that stack their children keep that value in different places.
 *
 * Every add and every removal keeps this in step with the array; a container hands over [declared],
 * [dropped] and [cleared] from the `addImpl`, `remove(int)` - which `Container.remove(Component)` reaches
 * as well - and `removeAll` it overrides.
