/**
 * A `JComboBox` over [items]: it shows the item that is selected and drops the full list down in a
 * popup for the user to choose from.
 *
 * The selection is controlled via [selectedItem] + [onSelectionChange], with `null` meaning no
 * selection. [onSelectionChange] reports the user's choices only: a declared [selectedItem] is the
 * composition's own state, so applying it - and rebuilding [items] under it - leaves the callback silent.
 * It is re-applied on every pass, so a choice the caller does not adopt is undone. The selection names an
 * item rather than a position, so items that compare equal are one and the same selection.
 *
 * @param items the list of items to display
 * @param selectedItem the selected item (controlled); `null` selects nothing, as does an item the current
 *   [items] do not contain
 * @param onSelectionChange callback invoked when the user chooses an item
 * @param modifier the [SwingModifier] applied to the underlying component
 * @param editable whether the user can type a value into the combo box's editor; `false` by default
 * @param onValueCommit callback invoked with the editor's text when an [editable] combo box's editor is
 *   committed; a text that matches no item is reported here and nowhere else, since [selectedItem]
 *   can only name an item. Left out, such a text goes unreported
 * @param maximumRowCount the maximum number of items the popup shows before it scrolls, or `null` to
 *   leave the count the box already carries
 * @param itemContent optional composable cell rendered per item against a [ListItemScope]; `null` keeps
 *   the default `toString` rendering. The display area composes a cell only for one of [items]: text
 *   typed into an [editable] editor renders empty there on the pass that turns [editable] off, until
 *   the next writes [selectedItem] back
 * @see javax.swing.JComboBox
