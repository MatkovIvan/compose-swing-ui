/**
 * The receiver of a [Layer]'s content, through which a child declares the region of the layer it fills.
 *
 * A layer holds two regions: the view it decorates, which a child names on its own `modifier`, and the
 * glass pane painted over that view, which is a composable of this scope rather than a builder because
 * the Swing slot behind it takes a panel the layer has to be given.
 *
 * ```
 * Layer(
 *     onPaint = { g, width, height, paintView ->
 *         paintView()
 *         g.paint = veil
 *         g.fillRect(0, 0, width, height)
 *     },
 * ) {
 *     Table(model = rows, modifier = SwingModifier.view())
 *     if (busy) {
 *         GlassPane { ProgressBar(value = 0, indeterminate = true) }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * A layer holds nothing besides the two regions, so every child names one and a child that names none is
 * refused, naming the layer and the builders that would place it. Each region shows one component, so
 * two children naming the same region are refused too. A child that goes away releases the region it
 * held: the view clears, and the glass pane is the one the layer carried before any declaration reached
 * it.
 *

     * The view is held in a slot of the layer rather than added to a container, so a widget that answers
