 * Places the component in its parent container under [constraint] - the value
 * `Container.add(Component, Object)` takes: a `BorderLayout` region name, a `GridBagConstraints`, a
 * `CardLayout` card name, or whatever the enclosing container's layout manager understands.
 *
 * The placement follows the value: change it and the component moves within the same parent, keeping its
 * position among its siblings. It reaches the node whose modifier declares it and travels no further, so a
 * container placed this way lays its own children out under the constraints each of them declares. The
 * last constraint declared in a modifier chain wins, and a modifier declaring none leaves the component placed by
 * index alone.
 *
 * The placement is re-applied whenever the declared value does not compare equal to the one applied last,
 * so a constraint compared by identity - as a raw `GridBagConstraints` is - re-registers the component on
 * every pass that rebuilds it. A constraint compared by value holds still when rebuilt from the same
 * declaration, which is what the scope builders -
 * [org.jetbrains.compose.swing.components.layout.GridBagPanelScope.item] among them - supply.
 *
 * The value is handed over the way `Container.add(Component, Object)` hands it over: a `LayoutManager2`
 * receives it as-is and reports a value it does not understand with its own exception, while a manager
 * that takes no constraints places the component by index.
 *
 * @param constraint the placement the parent container's layout manager registers the component under.
 * @return this modifier with the placement declared on it.

/**
 * Installs the component into its parent through [attachment] - one of the host's own dedicated setters
 * rather than the generic `Container.add` (e.g. a `JScrollPane` region reached via `setViewportView`).
 * The attachment belongs to the host: a container composable wrapping such a host is what hands each of
 * its regions the attachment that installs a component there and takes it out again.
 *
 * A host that holds its children this way says so, through
 * [org.jetbrains.compose.swing.node.ChildPlacement] on its own node, and every child composed under it
 * names a region: a modifier declaring none is refused there, and a modifier declaring one is refused under a
 * host that adds its children by index. The last region declared in a modifier chain wins, and a modifier declaring
 * a region as well as a [layoutConstraint] is refused, since a parent holds a child by one of the two.
 *
 * The placement follows the region named: a modifier naming another region moves the component there,
 * released from the region it fills through the [SlotAttachment] that filled it and installed through the
 * one named now, and a modifier that stops naming a region releases the one its component fills. The move
 * lands once the change pass that declared it has settled, so a pass that swaps what two regions hold
 * leaves each component in the region its own modifier names, whichever order the two declarations reach the
 * host in. The [attachment] is how the named region is filled rather than which region that is: one
 * carrying a declaration the host writes onto the region - a tab's title - re-declares that region's
 * contents without moving the component out of it. A node the host moves among its siblings keeps the
 * region it fills.
 *
 * @param name which region of the host this fills, written exactly as the call that fills it -
 *   `"SwingModifier.viewport()"`, `"SwingModifier.corner(UPPER_LEFT)"`. It identifies the region among
 *   the host's own, and it is what an error about that region prints, so a caller acts on that text by
 *   typing it.
 * @param attachment installs the component into the host and returns its uninstall action.
 * @return this modifier with the region declared on it.
