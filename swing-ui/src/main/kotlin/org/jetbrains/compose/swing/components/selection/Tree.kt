/**
 * A hierarchy the user opens and selects in: a `JTree` built from data, reporting what the user
 * selects, opens, and edits.
 *
 * The tree is described as data: [root] is the root value and [children] yields each value's child values,
 * walked recursively to build the displayed structure; [label] renders each value's row text (its
 * `toString` by default), and [nodeContent] renders a value's node as a composable of its own where a row
 * is more than text. The structure reflects the last composition - changing the data the accessors return
 * moves the tree on recompose. A tree follows the values its accessors answer with, so a value that
 * recomposes the tree is what moves it: mutating in place a child list a value already handed over leaves
 * the tree as it was until something else recomposes it. The child values a list hands over unchanged at
 * its front and at its back keep the nodes they had, staying open if they were open and selected if they
 * were selected while the rows around them shift; what lies between them settles by position, so there
 * openness and selection stay with the place rather than following the value. Selection is declared with
 * [selectedPaths] and expansion with [expandedPaths], each path expressed as the chain of child indices
 * from the root (so `[]` is the root, `[0]` its first child, `[0, 2]` that child's third child), and the
 * user's changes to either arrive through [onSelectionChange] and [onExpansionChange]. Place it in a
 * [org.jetbrains.compose.swing.components.layout.ScrollPane] to scroll.
 *
 * ```
 * ScrollPane {
 *     content {
 *         Tree(
 *             root = fileSystem,
 *             children = { it.entries },
 *             label = { it.name },
 *             selectedPaths = selection,
 *             onSelectionChange = { selection = it },
 *             expandedPaths = expansion,
 *             onExpansionChange = { expansion = it },
 *         )
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * [onSelectionChange] and [onExpansionChange] report the user's changes only; new data reaching the
 * structure produces neither. A declared selection or expansion is the composition's state and is
 * re-applied on every pass: it survives a new structure, and a user change the caller does not adopt does
 * not stand. Undeclared, either belongs to the user alone - the library never imposes one, and what the
 * user reached survives a new structure as well, the nodes they closed as much as the ones they opened. A
 * node the new structure no longer has is the exception: it leaves the selection, and [onSelectionChange]
 * reports what is left of it.
 *
 * A selection and an expansion that cannot both stand settle the way a `JTree` settles them: a closed node
 * shows none of its descendants, so it holds the selection in place of the ones it hides, and
 * [onSelectionChange] reports what the tree was left with.
 *
 * [hasChildren] decides which values are branches. A value [children] yields nothing for is a leaf, with
 * no handle to click; declaring [hasChildren] lets such a value call itself a branch all the same, so the
 * user can ask for children the data does not hold yet and [onWillExpand] - or [onExpansionChange] - is
 * where fetching them starts. [onWillExpand] also decides whether a node opens at all: returning `false`
 * leaves it closed.
 *
 * Editing is a report, never a mutation. While [isEditable] is on the user can edit a node's text in
 * place, and committing it hands [onNodeEdit] the value edited, its index path, and what was entered; the
 * row goes on showing what the data says until a later composition supplies data that says otherwise, and
 * the tree [root] and [children] describe is never written to.
 *
 * @param root the root value of the tree
 * @param children yields the child values of a value, in display order
 * @param modifier the [SwingModifier] applied to the underlying component
 * @param label renders a value's row text; a value's `toString` by default
 * @param hasChildren whether a value is a branch, asked for a value [children] yields none for; a value
 *   with children is a branch either way. `null` - the default - makes a childless value a leaf
 * @param selectedPaths the selected nodes as index paths from the root; `null` - the default - leaves the
 *   selection to the user
 * @param onSelectionChange callback invoked when the user changes the selection
 * @param expandedPaths the expanded nodes as index paths from the root; every other node is collapsed,
 *   except an ancestor of an expanded one, which stays expanded so that node is reachable. `null` - the
 *   default - leaves expansion to the tree and to the user
 * @param onExpansionChange callback invoked when the user expands or collapses a node, receiving every
 *   node that is then expanded
 * @param onWillExpand asked before a node opens - whether the user opened it or a declared expansion did
 *   - with the value and the index path of that node, and vetoes the expansion by returning `false`;
 *   `null` - the default - lets every expansion through
 * @param isEditable whether the user can edit a node's text in place; `false` - the default - leaves
 *   the nodes read-only
 * @param onNodeEdit callback invoked when an edit is committed, receiving the value edited, its index
 *   path, and the value entered; update the backing data from here so the next composition shows the edit.
 *   An edit still open on a node a later composition hands another value to - or takes out of the
 *   structure - ends there and commits nothing
 * @param selectionMode how many nodes may be selected; `DISCONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION` - the default -
 *   lets the user select any number of them
 * @param rootVisible whether the root node is shown; `true` - the default - shows it, and hiding it
 *   leaves its children as the top-level rows
 * @param showsRootHandles whether expand/collapse handles are shown for the top-level nodes;
 *   `null` leaves the choice to the installed look and feel
 * @param rowHeight the height of every row in pixels; `0` asks each node's rendering how tall it wants
 *   to be, which is what lets a composable node size itself. `null` - the default - leaves the height to
 *   the installed look and feel
 * @param visibleRowCount how many rows the tree asks a viewport to make room for; `20` is the default,
 *   and it has no effect outside a scroll pane
 * @param toggleClickCount how many clicks on a node expand or collapse it; `2` - the default - is a
 *   double click, and `0` takes that gesture away

 * is the two combined - a node is only selectable where its ancestors are open - so applying one without
 * the other would leave the tree standing on a pairing neither declaration asked for. Each mirror still
 * sees the write as its own, which is what the nesting inside [settleSelection] is for. The mirrors hold
