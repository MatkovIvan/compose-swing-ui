/**
 * The properties this library leaves to the installed look and feel, and what each is worth under it.
 *
 * A property belongs here only where the key is the one channel that reaches the widget - where no UI
 * delegate writes the property itself. A property a delegate installs is not readable this way: a
 * look and feel may install it from a style table these keys do not reach, and answering from the key
 * would hand back a value the widget never carried. Declare that kind through
 * [property][org.jetbrains.compose.swing.modifier.property] instead, which restores what the widget
 * was found holding.
 *
 * Each is read on every access, since a look and feel installed later answers differently. Where the
 * installed one names nothing, the answer is the value the widget carries until something writes it.
