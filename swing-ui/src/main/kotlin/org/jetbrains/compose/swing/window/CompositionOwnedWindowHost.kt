/**
 * Wires a composition-owned top-level AWT [peer] (a [javax.swing.JFrame] or [javax.swing.JDialog])
 * into the enclosing composition: it forwards the window-closing gesture to [onCloseRequest], installs
 * the geometry write-back, hosts [content] as a child of the enclosing composition - under a
 * [WindowScope] standing for [peer] - and pushes the reactive chrome ([title], [resizable],
 * [alwaysOnTop], [iconImage], [minimumSize]) and geometry onto the peer.
 *
 * [peer] itself is reactive. A caller that must rebuild its peer - because a property AWT accepts only
 * on a window that is not yet realized changed - hands the replacement in, and the wiring follows: the
 * previous peer loses its content, its listeners and its own peer, and the replacement is wired and
 * hosted from scratch.
 *
 * The shape of the two directions matches the two-way geometry model: [applyDeclaredGeometry] reads the
 * hoisted state under a snapshot observer, so a window system reporting a drag or a resize - which
 * [setPosition] and [setSize] carry back into that same state - re-runs the apply rather than
 * recomposing anything.
 *
 * Everything that is specific to one kind of peer is threaded in as a lambda: [installExtras] alongside
 * the wiring this function installs, [applyExtras] at the tail of the observed apply (after geometry, so
 * it can flip visibility once the peer is sized and positioned), and [disposePeer] at the very end of
 * teardown, so a caller can interleave its own steps (for example, hiding a modal dialog before it is
 * disposed).
 *
 * @param peer the top-level window this composition owns.
 * @param onCloseRequest called when the window system reports a closing gesture.
 * @param title the window title.
 * @param resizable whether the user may resize the window.
 * @param alwaysOnTop whether the window stays above the windows of other applications.
 * @param iconImage the window icon, or `null` to leave whatever the platform shows.
 * @param minimumSize the smallest size the user may resize the window to, or `null` for none.
 * @param applyDeclaredGeometry pushes the geometry the hoisted state holds onto the peer, reading that
 *   state as it runs. It runs on every recomposition and again whenever the state it read changes, so
 *   what it reads is what drives the peer - a value read anywhere else is applied only as often as the
 *   composable that read it recomposes.
 * @param setPosition carries a position the window system reports back into the hoisted state.
 * @param setSize carries a size the window system reports back into the hoisted state.
 * @param appliedGeometry the mirror that tells the peer's own moves and resizes from the ones applied
 *   to it, so only the former are carried back.
 * @param installExtras registers any additional listeners in the same [DisposableEffect] as the wiring
 *   installed here, and returns their removal. It runs once per peer, while the state a listener writes
 *   into is declared afresh on every recomposition, so a listener it installs has to reach that state
 *   through a handle the recomposition refreshes - `rememberUpdatedState`. A listener that captures the
 *   state declared when the peer was wired keeps writing into the one the caller has moved on from,
 *   instead of the one a caller that hoists its state somewhere else has moved to.
 * @param applyExtras applies whatever this kind of peer carries alongside its geometry, reading the
 *   hoisted state the same way [applyDeclaredGeometry] does.
 * @param disposePeer disposes the peer, at the very end of teardown.
 * @param content the window's content, composed against a [WindowScope] standing for [peer].
