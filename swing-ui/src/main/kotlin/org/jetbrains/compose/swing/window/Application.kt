/**
 * An entry point for the Compose application. See [awaitApplication] for more information.
 *
 * Usually this entry point is used inside the `main()` function:
 * ```
 * fun main() = application {
 *
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * After all windows are closed and all operations are completed, the application ends.
 * Set [exitProcessOnExit] to `false` if you need to execute some code after the [application]
 * block; otherwise that code won't be executed, as [application] exits the process.
 *
 * This entry point is a blocking operation (it blocks the current thread until the application
 * finishes) and can't be called on the UI thread. To launch a new application from the UI thread
 * (for example, from some event listener), use [launchApplication] instead.
 *
 * The application can launch background tasks using [androidx.compose.runtime.LaunchedEffect]
 * or create [Window], [Dialog], or [org.jetbrains.compose.swing.components.Tray] in a declarative
 * Compose way:
 *
 * ```
 * fun main() = application {
 *     var isSplashScreenShowing by remember { mutableStateOf(true) }
 *
 *     LaunchedEffect(Unit) {
 *         delay(2000)
 *         isSplashScreenShowing = false
 *     }
 *
 *     if (isSplashScreenShowing) {
 *         Window(::exitApplication, title = "Splash") {}
 *     } else {
 *         Window(::exitApplication, title = "App") {}
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When there are no active compositions left, this function ends.
 * An active composition is one that has an active coroutine (for example, launched in
 * [androidx.compose.runtime.LaunchedEffect]) or a child composition created inside [Window],
 * [Dialog], or [org.jetbrains.compose.swing.components.Tray].
 *
 * @param exitProcessOnExit whether `exitProcess(0)` is called after the application is closed.
 * The explicit exit ends the process immediately instead of waiting for background threads to wind
 * down. If `false`, the execution of the function is unblocked after the application exits
 * (when the last window is closed, and all [androidx.compose.runtime.LaunchedEffect]s are complete).
 * @see [awaitApplication]
