 *
 * Every composition reads this, so turning it on reaches the ones already running as well as the ones
 * mounted afterwards. Each rebuilds its content afresh and records as it composes, because the runtime
 * writes source information only as content is inserted. That rebuild lands on a later recomposition
 * pass, so a composition answers once it has recomposed rather than by the time this returns, and it
 * discards everything `remember`ed inside the content while state hoisted above it survives.
 *
 * Turning it off reverses both: each composition builds its content afresh once more, this time without
 * recording, and withdraws what it published. A composition answers for what it declared only while this
 * is on.
 *
 * A composition reads this when its own pass runs, not when the assignment returns, so turning it on and
 * off again within one turn of the event loop leaves everything as it was.
 *
 * Content mounted under a context a caller captured with `rememberCompositionContext()` is reached on
 * the next pass it takes for any reason, rather than on one this brings about: what such a composition
 * reads of this stands above its content, and invalidating that reaches the composition around it rather
 * than the composition itself. Content a window drives is reached at once.
 *
 * [attachComposeStackTrace] needs one thing more of the application: the Compose runtime hands out what a
 * trace is built from only while it is in a diagnostic stack trace mode, which
 * `Composer.setDiagnosticStackTraceMode(ComposeStackTraceMode.SourceInformation)` puts it in. That is the
 * application's to set - it is process-wide - so this switch neither sets it nor puts it back.
 * [findCompositionData] answers in full without it.
 *
 * Must be set on the Event Dispatch Thread.
