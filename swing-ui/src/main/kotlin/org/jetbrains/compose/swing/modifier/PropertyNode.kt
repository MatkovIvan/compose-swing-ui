 * runs the captured restore. [read] reads the current value (for capture), [write] applies a value,
 * and [valueProvider] supplies the value to write — refreshed by the owning element's `update`.
 *
 * This is the shape every appearance/layout/metadata/accessibility property element shares: capture
 * once, write the new value, restore on removal. The restore is held as a closure over the captured
 * value, so no value is stored or cast back through erasure.
