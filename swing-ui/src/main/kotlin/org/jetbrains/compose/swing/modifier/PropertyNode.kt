/**
 * A [SwingModifier.Node] for a single component property. On [onAttach] it captures the property's
 * pre-modifier value as a restore action; on each apply it writes the latest value; on [onDetach] it
 * runs the captured restore. [read] reads the current value (for capture) and [write] applies a value.
 *
 * This is the shape every appearance/layout/metadata/accessibility property element shares: capture
 * once, write the new value, restore on removal. The restore is held as a closure over the captured
 * value, so no value is stored or cast back through erasure.
 *
 * For a property a component inherits from its parent when it declares none of its own - cursor, font,
 * background, foreground - [read] must return the component's *own* value, and `null` where the matching
 * `isXSet` is false.
 *
 * [interference] names the way another write and this one reach each other; see [PropertyInterference].
 * A second property this [write] overwrites is held beside the declared one and put back after it, so
 * its restore is the last write to reach it. Without that, a removal leaves it wherever the declared
 * property's restore left it, with no declaration naming it.
 *
 * Both are held through the modifier's [PropertyCaptures].

 * and hold the *same* [read] and [write] instances - identity, because a lambda capturing anything is
 * a fresh instance on every pass and the two accessors it holds may then differ in what they capture
 * while sharing a class. A property whose accessors are allocated once (a builder's non-capturing

 * that captures compares unequal and is written on every pass.
