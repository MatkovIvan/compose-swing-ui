 * @property matchesParentSize whether the child takes the box's whole extent, and so sets none of it.
 * @property fillsWidth whether the child takes the box's whole width, while still setting its height.
 * @property fillsHeight whether the child takes the box's whole height, while still setting its width.
 * @property zIndex where in the stack the child sits, the largest on top.
