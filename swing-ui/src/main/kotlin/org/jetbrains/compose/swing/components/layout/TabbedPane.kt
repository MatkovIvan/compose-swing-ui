/**
 * A stack of pages of which one shows at a time, picked from a strip of tabs - a `JTabbedPane`. The
 * pane holds which tab is selected and reports the tab the user clicks.
 *
 * A pane holds each child as the page of a tab rather than as an indexed child of a layout, so every child
 * of [content] declares the tab it is the body of on its own modifier, with `SwingModifier.tab(...)` - the
 * one region a pane offers (see [TabbedPaneScope]). A child declaring no tab is refused as it arrives,
 * naming the pane and that call. A pane shows one tab per child and any number of them, so two children
 * declaring a tab are two tabs.
 *
 * Tabs are **dynamic**: emitting or dropping a child adds or removes the tab it is the body of, and a tab's
 * title/icon/tooltip/enabled update on recomposition. The selected tab is controlled via [selectedIndex],
 * and [onSelectedIndexChange] reports the tab the user selects; a click the caller does not answer with a
 * matching [selectedIndex] is settled back, so the pane returns to the declared tab. A tab may also carry
 * a `header` composable that renders the tab in the strip in place of its title and icon.
 *
 * [selectedIndex] is `-1` for no selected tab, the value a `JTabbedPane` itself holds while none is
 * selected. Any other value has to name a tab that is there: where it names none - dropping the selected
 * tab without moving the index leaves it naming none - the pane falls back on a neighbor and reports that
 * tab through [onSelectedIndexChange], since it is the tab the pane is on and not the one declared.
 *
 * ```
 * TabbedPane(selectedIndex = sel, onSelectedIndexChange = { sel = it }) {
 *     Column(SwingModifier.tab("General")) { GeneralSettings() }
 *     Column(SwingModifier.tab("Advanced", enabled = false)) { AdvancedSettings() }
 *     Column(SwingModifier.tab("Console", header = { Label("Console") })) { Console() }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param selectedIndex the index of the selected tab, or `-1` for none (controlled); `-1` while the
 *   pane holds tabs leaves the strip with no tab selected and no page shown
 * @param onSelectedIndexChange callback invoked with the index of the tab the user selects, and with the
 *   tab the pane is left on where [selectedIndex] names no tab of the strip
 * @param modifier the [SwingModifier] applied to the underlying `JTabbedPane`
 * @param tabPlacement where the tab strip is drawn; `TOP` by default
 * @param tabLayoutPolicy how the tab strip handles overflow; the default `WRAP_TAB_LAYOUT` wraps the
 *   tabs that do not fit onto further runs of the strip, and a look and feel supporting only one of the
 *   policies ignores it
 * @param content the composable content of the pane, one child per tab; see [TabbedPaneScope]
 * @see javax.swing.JTabbedPane

 * - a declaration the pane can honor already updates it to the pane's post-write value, so only this
 * separate, deliberately-lagging record catches the fallback case.
 *
 * The fallback reaches [listener] directly rather than from inside a write, so it runs contained the same
