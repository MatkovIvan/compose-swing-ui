/**
 * One table's row-sorting channel: the sorter that orders and filters the table's rows while sorting is on,
 * and the listener through which the user's own header clicks reach the caller's [target] listener.
 *
 * A sorter is welded to the model it was built for - it holds that model's row count and answers that
 * model's events - so it comes off before the table takes another model and is built again over the model
 * the table is left holding. Sorting off leaves the table without a sorter at all, which is what a bare
 * `JTable` is, and the sort order, the row filter and the columns' own sorting rules all reach the table
 * through that sorter, so they stand exactly while it does.
 *
 * [mirror] mirrors the order the rows are in, which is what makes a header click an ordinary composition
 * dependency and what tells that click from the writes this channel makes itself.
