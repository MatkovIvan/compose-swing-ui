/**
 * A scrolling view onto content larger than the room it has - a `JScrollPane`, with the viewport it
 * scrolls and the headers and corners that stay put beside it declared as content.
 *
 * The pane holds each of its children in one of its own regions - the viewport, the row header, the
 * column header, and each of the four corners - rather than as an indexed child. So every child names
 * the region it goes in, through [ScrollPaneScope], and a child naming none is refused. Each region
 * holds one view, so two children naming the same one are refused as well, and a child that goes away
 * releases the region it held:
 *
 * ```
 * ScrollPane {
 *     LongList(modifier = SwingModifier.viewport())
 *     ColumnTitles(modifier = SwingModifier.columnHeader())
 *     CornerBadge(modifier = SwingModifier.corner(JScrollPane.UPPER_TRAILING_CORNER))
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Set a fixed viewport size with `modifier = SwingModifier.preferredSize(...)`.
 *
 * The scroll position is hoistable state, so the application can read it, drive it, and follow the
 * user's scrolling:
 *
 * ```
 * val scroll = rememberScrollState()
 * Button(text = "To the bottom", onClick = { scroll.y = scroll.maxY })
 * ScrollPane(state = scroll) {
 *     LongList(modifier = SwingModifier.viewport())
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * How far the pane scrolls per arrow button and per page, and whether the content is laid out at the
 * viewport's own width or height, are the content's to declare - see [ScrollPaneScope.viewport].
 *
 * @param modifier the [SwingModifier] applied to the underlying `JScrollPane`
 * @param state the pane's two-way scroll position; see [ScrollState]. Left out, the pane gets a state
 *   of its own, which nothing outside it reads or drives
 * @param verticalScrollbar the vertical scrollbar policy; by default the bar is there only while the
 *   content is taller than the viewport
 * @param horizontalScrollbar the horizontal scrollbar policy; by default the bar is there only while
 *   the content is wider than the viewport
 * @param viewportBorder the border drawn around the viewport, inside the pane's own border and outside
 *   the scrolled content; `null` leaves the border to the installed look and feel, and withdrawing a
 *   declared border hands the look and feel's own back
 * @param wheelScrollingEnabled whether the mouse wheel scrolls the pane; `true` by default
 * @param content the composable content of the pane; see [ScrollPaneScope]
 * @see javax.swing.JScrollPane
