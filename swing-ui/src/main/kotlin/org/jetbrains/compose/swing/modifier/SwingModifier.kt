/**
 * An ordered, immutable collection of styling/behavior [Element]s applied to a Swing component —
 * the Swing analogue of `androidx.compose.ui.Modifier`.
 *
 * Build a chain by calling the builder extensions off the [companion][SwingModifier.Companion]
 * (`SwingModifier.foreground(c).border(b)`, see the sibling `*Modifiers.kt` files) and pass it to a
 * component's `modifier` parameter. The empty modifier ([SwingModifier] itself, the companion)
 * applies nothing and is the parameter default.
 *
 * Implement [Element] to wrap any Swing property or listener the library does not ship a builder
 * for. See `docs/CUSTOM-COMPONENTS.md`.
 *
 * An [Element] declares the component type it targets via [Element.targetType]. A modifier targeting
 * a type the node is not (e.g. `border`, a `JComponent` property, on a bare `java.awt.Component`)
 * fails with a clear error naming the element and the required vs. actual type.
 *
 * Conditional composition works the way it does in Compose: `if (selected) it.background(blue)
 * else it` adds the background when selected and removes it (restoring the value the component had
 * before the modifier first touched that property) when not.
 *
 * The modifier is immutable and safe to share, hoist, and reuse as a theme token. A modifier hoisted
 * into a `remember { … }` (or otherwise referentially stable) is applied once and skipped on every
 * recomposition where it is unchanged.

     *   This is the right shape for appearance/layout writes (`background`, `border`, …) where one
     *   value wins.
     * - A **subscription** element ([additive] `true`) is its own slot for every application, matched
     *   across recompositions by position rather than by [key]. This is the right shape for listeners,
     *   which are inherently additive in Swing: two `onHover {}` both install and both fire.
