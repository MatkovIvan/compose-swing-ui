/**
 * An ordered, immutable collection of styling/behavior [NodeElement]s applied to a Swing component -
 * the Swing analogue of `androidx.compose.ui.Modifier`.
 *
 * Build a chain by calling the builder extensions off the [companion][SwingModifier.Companion]
 * (`SwingModifier.foreground(c).border(b)`, see the sibling `*Modifiers.kt` files) and pass it to a
 * component's `modifier` parameter. The empty modifier ([SwingModifier] itself, the companion)
 * applies nothing and is the parameter default.
 *
 * Implement [NodeElement] to wrap any Swing property or listener the library does not ship a builder
 * for. See `docs/CUSTOM-COMPONENTS.md`.
 *
 * An [NodeElement] declares the component type it targets via [NodeElement.targetType]. A modifier targeting
 * a type the node is not (e.g. `border`, a `JComponent` property, on a bare `java.awt.Component`)
 * fails with a clear error naming the element and the required vs. actual type.
 *
 * Conditional composition works the way it does in Compose: `if (selected) it.background(blue)
 * else it` adds the background when selected and removes it (restoring the value the component had
 * before the modifier first touched that property) when not.
 *
 * The modifier is immutable and safe to share, hoist, and reuse as a theme token. Building the chain
 * inline in the composable body is the intended style and needs no `remember`: a chain declaring what
 * the one last applied to a component declares is skipped, and each element is judged on its own, so a
 * property whose declared value has not changed is not written again, until something declared before
 * it writes. See [NodeElement] for what an element that did change costs.
 *
 * A modifier is applied *to* a node, and a node *holds* the modifier state that outlives one
 * apply pass, so `modifier` and `node` are one boundary read from two sides, not two layers - a
 * declaration belongs with the type it is an operation on.

     * installed is not reattached. So a callback written inline as a lambda is the intended style and needs
     * no `remember` - push it onto the node in [update] and have the node read it when the event fires.
     *
     * An element is one of two kinds, selected by [additive]: a **property** element (the default),
     * right for a value like `background` or `border`, or a **subscription** element, right for a
     * listener like `onHover`. See [additive] and [key] for how each kind is matched across

     * [equals] and [hashCode] are abstract, so every element states its own equality: the slot skips an
     * incoming element equal to the one it holds, unless it is a property element and a property
     * declared before it has already written on this pass - see [update] for that second occasion.
     * Compare a value structurally - a `data class` says that in one word - and compare anything the
     * node *registers* (a listener, a callback, a binding, a slot attachment) with
     * `===`, since such a field may carry an `equals` of its own under which two instances the node must
