/**
 * Two sides of one area, split by a divider the user drags to give one side room at the other's expense
 * - a `JSplitPane`. The pane holds the divider offset and reports the moves the user makes.
 *
 * The pane holds its children on two sides of its own, `first` and `second`, rather than among indexed
 * children, so every child names the side it occupies on its own modifier, through [SplitPaneScope]:
 * ```
 * SplitPane(orientation = JSplitPane.HORIZONTAL_SPLIT) {
 *     Navigator(modifier = SwingModifier.first())
 *     Editor(modifier = SwingModifier.second())
 * }
 * ```
 * A side hosts one child: dropping a child (e.g. behind an `if`) empties the side it occupied, a side no
 * child names stays empty, and a child that names no side at all is refused.
 *
 * Pass an offset as [dividerLocation] to place the divider; [onDividerLocationChange] fires with
 * the new offset when the user moves it. An offset is applied when it changes and is not asserted
 * again, so a divider the user has dragged stays where they left it. The default `-1` is
 * `JSplitPane`'s own initial divider location, asking the pane to derive the position from the sides'
 * preferred sizes (shaped by [resizeWeight]); the pane keeps that request as its divider location until
 * it is realized on screen, at which point it resolves the position itself - that resolution is the
 * look and feel settling the request, not a move, and is not reported.
 *
 * @param modifier the [SwingModifier] applied to the underlying `JSplitPane`
 * @param orientation the axis along which the two sides are arranged; the default
 *   `HORIZONTAL_SPLIT` puts them side by side, with the divider running top to bottom
 * @param dividerLocation the divider offset in pixels (controlled), a value the look and feel reads; a
 *   negative offset - the default `-1` is `JSplitPane`'s own initial divider location - resets the
 *   divider to honor the sides' preferred sizes
 * @param onDividerLocationChange callback invoked with the new offset when the user moves the
 *   divider; an offset the declaration itself applies is not reported, nor is the position a negative
 *   request resolves to once the pane is realized on screen
 * @param resizeWeight how extra space is shared when the pane resizes, from `0.0` (all to the second
 *   side) to `1.0` (all to the first side); the default `0.0` leaves the first side the size it has,
 *   and a weight outside `0.0`..`1.0` is refused
 * @param oneTouchExpandable whether the divider carries a widget that collapses either side in one
 *   click; `null` leaves the choice to the installed look and feel, withdrawing a declared choice hands
 *   it back, and a look and feel that does not support one-touch expanding ignores it
 * @param dividerSize the divider thickness in pixels; `null` leaves the size to the installed look and
 *   feel, and withdrawing a declared size hands it back
 * @param continuousLayout whether the two sides are laid out continuously as the divider is dragged
 *   rather than once it is released, where the drag draws an outline of where the divider is heading;
 *   `null` leaves the choice to the installed look and feel, and withdrawing a declared choice hands it
 *   back
 * @param content the composable content of the pane; see [SplitPaneScope]
 * @see javax.swing.JSplitPane
