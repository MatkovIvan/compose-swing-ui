 * with the last content composed under it, with the window, and with a failure - see
 * [SwingRecomposer]; a call after that hands out a fresh one.

 * a container already under this window resolves to on its own. Creating is what this is for: a caller
 * asks to compose into the answer, so a context taken and held across a moment when the window composes
 * nothing is the one case where the answer goes stale.
 *
 * A window whose content composes under a composition declared elsewhere drives none of its own and is
 * refused here, because a context created for it would drive nothing: a window declared inside
 * `application { }` runs as part of that application's composition, whose recomposer is
 * [org.jetbrains.compose.swing.window.ApplicationScope.recomposer].
