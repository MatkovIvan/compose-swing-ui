 * have no extent for a policy to divide among its children, so they ask what the policy wants; of the
 * three, only `layoutContainer` has a rectangle. The other rectangle comes from outside: a parent
 * measuring this container offers one through [ChildMeasurables.measuredSize], which places nothing.
