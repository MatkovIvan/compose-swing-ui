/*
 * Data-transfer SwingModifiers - drag-and-drop and system-clipboard support. Drag source, drop
 * target, and clipboard copy/cut/paste can all be declared on the same component and coexist. The set
 * of allowed operations is a [TransferAction] `TransferHandler` action bit-mask.
 *
 * A drag source and an export-done declaration are equal when they declare the same action mask and
 * hold the *same* callbacks - identity, because a callback is what it captures - so one made of
 * hoisted callbacks refreshes nothing.
 *
 * A drop target and a clipboard declaration both claim the handler's import slice, and the modifier's
 * last claimant owns it. Each is therefore compared by identity alone, so both re-assert that order on
 * every pass: one of them standing still while the other moved would leave the slice with whichever
 * moved, wherever it sits in the modifier.

/**
 * Makes the component a drag SOURCE that exports a [Transferable] when dragged.

 * [exportedActions] declares which operations the source offers (a [TransferAction] `TransferHandler`
 * action bit-mask, e.g. `TransferHandler.COPY`, `TransferHandler.COPY_OR_MOVE`); a drop is permitted
 * only for an operation also accepted by the target. [transferable] is invoked when a drag begins on
 * the component and returns the data to transfer, or `null` to start no drag.
 *
 * The outcome of every export - the completed action, including a `MOVE` whose data the source
 * should remove - is reported through [onExportDone].
 *
 * Declaring a source takes over the component's export: [transferable] and [exportedActions] are what
 * it exports and what it offers, in place of whatever it exported on its own. Its import is left
 * alone - without a [dropTarget] or a [clipboard] on the same component, a drop or a paste is handled
 * exactly as the component handles it.
 *
 * Requires a [JComponent] target. Composes with [dropTarget] and [clipboard] on the same component:
 * all three configure one underlying transfer handler, so a component can be a drag source, a drop
 * target, and clipboard-enabled at once. [transferable] and [exportedActions] are read on each drag,
 * so passing fresh values across recompositions takes effect immediately.
 *
 * @param exportedActions the operations this source offers, as a [TransferAction] mask;
 *   `TransferHandler.NONE` leaves the gesture recognized but starts no drag.
 * @param transferable produces the exported data; the same value answers a clipboard copy or cut whose
 *   operation [exportedActions] offers, so one exporter drives both directions.

/**
 * Enables system-clipboard copy/cut export and paste import on the component, over the same transfer
 * handler [draggable] and [dropTarget] use.

 * Copy and cut export the value [transferable] produces to the system clipboard; copy completes as a
 * `TransferHandler.COPY` and cut as a `TransferHandler.MOVE`, the action reported through
 * [onExportDone], where a source implementing cut semantics removes the moved data. Paste reads the
 * system clipboard and, when [canImport] accepts the available flavors, hands the clipboard
 * [Transferable] to [onPaste], which returns whether the import succeeded. [canImport] defaults to
 * accepting any flavor.
 *
 * Declaring a clipboard takes over both directions: copy and cut export [transferable] and a paste
 * imports through [onPaste], in place of whatever the component exported and imported on its own.
 *
 * When [bindKeys] is `true` (the default), the platform copy/cut/paste keystrokes (the menu-shortcut
 * modifier with `C`/`X`/`V`) are bound on the component so the standard shortcuts trigger these
 * operations while it is focused; pass `false` to enable the operations without installing key
 * bindings (e.g. to drive them from your own menu). Requires a [JComponent] target. All callbacks are
 * read live, so passing fresh lambdas across recompositions takes effect immediately.
 *
 * Pass a [handle] from [rememberClipboardHandle] to also trigger copy/cut/paste programmatically. The
 * handle binds to the component this modifier is applied to, so [ClipboardHandle.copy],
 * [ClipboardHandle.cut] and [ClipboardHandle.paste] drive these same operations from an event handler
 * (e.g. a menu item) without the caller ever touching the [JComponent].
 *
 * @param transferable produces the value a copy or a cut puts on the clipboard; `null` puts nothing
 *   there and leaves the previous contents standing.
 * @param onPaste imports the clipboard contents; its result is what [ClipboardHandle.paste] returns.
 * @param canImport gates a paste by the flavors the clipboard offers.
 * @param bindKeys whether the platform copy/cut/paste keystrokes are bound on the component;
 *   toggling it binds or unbinds them in place.
