/**
 * Runs [onSizeChanged] with the extent the component occupies, whenever a layout pass changes it.
 *
 * A child is measured by whatever its parent decides, so this is how the caller who declared the
 * constraints learns what came of them. After the first extent has been reported, a pass that lays the
 * component out at that same extent, or that moves it without resizing it, reports nothing. Declaring
 * this onto a component already placed at a non-zero extent likewise waits for a new extent; an initial
 * zero extent is reported on the first resize event because it is a valid settled result.
 *
 * The report arrives on the event dispatch thread after the component has taken its new extent, so the
 * component already reads as the extent handed to the callback.
 *
 * [onSizeChanged] is read when the report fires, so writing a fresh lambda on every recomposition
 * registers nothing again. Declaring this twice reports twice: each declaration is its own slot.
 *
 * @param onSizeChanged receives the extent as its own value, safe to keep.
 * @return this chain with the extent report declared on it.

 * been reported, a pass that lays the component out where it already stood reports nothing, and neither
 * does an ancestor moving: the bounds are stated in the parent's coordinates, which a move further up
 * does not change.

/**
 * One layout report: it hands what [read] takes off the component to the callback declared right now,
 * unless that is the reading it holds as reported already.
 *
 * The held reading answers two questions at once. AWT states a resize and a move as two notifications,
 * so one placement doing both arrives twice, and a move arrives carrying a reading only the bounds
 * carry; holding the last one makes either a single report of what actually changed. The first event is
 * still delivered when it repeats an attach-time zero extent: zero is a real settled result, not the
 * absence of one.
 *
 * And the chain writes geometry before this is listening, whatever order the caller declares it in:
 * every geometry modifier is a keyed element and every listener an additive one, and a pass applies all
 * of the keyed elements before any of the additive ones. Whether AWT even announces such a write is not
 * this modifier's to know - `Component.notifyNewBounds` posts nothing unless some listener is already
 * attached, which depends on what else the chain carries. [seedFrom] takes the reading at attach so the
 * outcome is the same either way: the report names a change from where the component already stood,
 * announced or not.
