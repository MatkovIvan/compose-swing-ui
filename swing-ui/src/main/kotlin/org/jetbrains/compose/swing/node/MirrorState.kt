/**
 * Mirrors the value a widget property currently holds - a property the widget can change on its own,
 * independently of the composition's declaration - and carries a change the composition has not
 * answered for to the scope that declares it.
 *
 * The mirror is that value as a [State], so [value] answers with what the widget holds now, and reading
 * it while composing subscribes - as [subscribe] does for a component that needs the news without
 * the value. A widget property is not versioned, so what [value] answers with is the live value rather
 * than any snapshot's.
 *
 * A component subscribed to the mirror is invalidated when the widget's value changes under its
 * declaration - whether the user changed it, or a write to some other property of the same widget did.
 * A change a [settle] made and recorded the widget's answer to is the one kind that invalidates nothing:
 * it is where the declaration was already heading, and the pass that made it has already been told where
 * it landed. Settling - reconciling a declaration against what the widget holds - runs during a
 * composition pass, not at the moment of the change, because the declaration to settle against only
 * exists while a pass is running.
 *
 * A change is reported as it happens, and the caller either adopts it into its declared state or does
 * not. The next pass acts on that answer: an adopted change leaves the widget alone, an unadopted one
 * writes the declaration back, so the widget snaps away from what the user left it holding.
 *
 * Swing asks for the repaint a change provokes while the widget is still handling it, ahead of anything
 * the report of that change can schedule. A change carried to the caller through [report] settles inside
 * the event that made it wherever a frame can run there, so the declaration is back on the widget before
 * that repaint is served and the rejected value is never shown. A change only [observed] leaves the pass
 * a later event, following within a few event-dispatch cycles, inside a single display refresh interval:
 * the widget can be painted once holding a value the caller rejected, and what is bounded is how long
 * that value survives. A reported change takes that same later pass where a frame is already running, or
 * where something else is waiting for one.
 *
 * Runs on the event dispatch thread.
 *
 * @param initial the value the widget holds before any declaration has been settled onto it.

 * that follows the user taking the widget away from the declaration - nothing polls; reading the
 * widget's mirrored value is what subscribes the component to those changes.

 * ```
 * declare(checked, mirror, JCheckBox::isSelected, JCheckBox::setSelected)

 * @param write puts a value onto the widget, marked as the library's own so the events it raises are
