/**
 * A column of rows the user picks from: a `JList` showing one row per item, reporting what the user
 * selects.
 *
 * Items are declarative data. By default each row renders its item's `toString`; supply [itemContent]
 * to render an arbitrary composable cell per row (a `Row` of an icon, labels, ...). Selection is declared
 * with [selectedIndices] and reported through [onSelectionChange], expressed as the general multi-select
 * shape so one component covers all of [SelectionMode]'s modes. Place it in a
 * [org.jetbrains.compose.swing.components.layout.ScrollPane] to scroll:
 *
 * ```
 * ScrollPane {
 *     content {
 *         ListBox(items = rows, selectedIndices = sel, onSelectionChange = { sel = it }) { row ->
 *             Panel { Label(row.icon); Label(row.name) }
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * [onSelectionChange] reports the user's selection changes only, once per settled change - so dragging
 * across rows produces one callback at the end rather than one per row crossed, and rendering new
 * [items] produces none. A declared selection is the composition's state and is re-applied on every pass:
 * it survives an items change (an index the current items no longer cover is dropped), and a user change
 * the caller does not adopt does not stand. Undeclared, the selection is the user's alone - never
 * imposed, and kept across an items change all the same; where the new items are too few to hold it, the
 * rows that fall outside them leave the selection and [onSelectionChange] reports what is left of it.
 *
 * [layoutOrientation] decides how the cells are laid out: a single column, or wrapped into as many
 * columns or rows as the space the list is given allows. A wrapping list draws far more cells at once,
 * and a list sizes itself by measuring them - one measurement per row through the renderer, and with a
 * composable [itemContent] each of those is a cell stamped through a nested composition. Declaring a
 * [prototypeCellValue] collapses that to a single measurement every cell is sized by; [fixedCellWidth]
 * and [fixedCellHeight] state a size outright and spare it even that one.
 *
 * @param items the items to display
 * @param modifier the [SwingModifier] applied to the underlying component
 * @param selectedIndices the selected row indices the caller declares; `null` - the default - leaves the
 *   selection to the user
 * @param onSelectionChange callback invoked when the user settles on a new selection
 * @param selectionMode how many rows/ranges may be selected; `MULTIPLE_INTERVAL_SELECTION` - the
 *   default - lets the user select any number of ranges
 * @param visibleRowCount how many rows the list asks a viewport to make room for; `8` is the default.
 *   Under `VERTICAL_WRAP` it is the number of rows a column holds before the cells wrap into the next
 *   one. Under `HORIZONTAL_WRAP` the list takes its column count from it and then fits the items into as
 *   few rows as those columns need, which can come out below the count asked for
 * @param layoutOrientation whether the cells form a single column or wrap into columns or rows;
 *   `VERTICAL` - the default - is the single column
 * @param prototypeCellValue an item measured once, through the same renderer the rows use, to size every
 *   cell; `null` - the default - measures each row for itself
 * @param fixedCellWidth the width in pixels of every cell; `-1` - the default - takes the width from
 *   [prototypeCellValue], or from each row's own measurement where no prototype is declared
 * @param fixedCellHeight the height in pixels of every cell; `-1` - the default - takes the height from
 *   [prototypeCellValue], or from each row's own measurement where no prototype is declared
 * @param itemContent optional composable cell rendered per row against a [ListItemScope]; `null` keeps
 *   the default `toString` rendering
 * @see javax.swing.JList
