/**
 * How a [Row] or [Column] places its children along the axis it arranges them on, and how much space it
 * leaves between two adjacent children.
 *
 * An arrangement is handed the extent the container has along that axis together with the extent of each
 * child, and answers with each child's position. The children keep the extent they asked for, so what an
 * arrangement decides is where the space left over goes: [Start], [End], [Top], [Bottom] and [Center]
 * keep the children together and put all of it on one side or split it evenly; [SpaceBetween],
 * [SpaceAround] and [SpaceEvenly] share it out between them; [spacedBy] holds a fixed gap between
 * adjacent children and places the group as a whole.
 *
 * `spacing` is the gap an arrangement holds between two adjacent children, in pixels. A container
 * reserves it before it measures, so it is part of the size the container asks for.
