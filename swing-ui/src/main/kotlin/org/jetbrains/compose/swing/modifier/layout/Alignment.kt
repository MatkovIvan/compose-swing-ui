/**
 * Sets the horizontal alignment along the x axis, where `0.0` aligns to the left, `0.5` centers, and
 * `1.0` aligns to the right. A parent that honors alignment - a vertical `BoxLayout` - lines its
 * children up by this value, so siblings given the same alignment stay in one column.
 *
 * A component holding no alignment of its own reports the one its layout manager derives - a
 * `BoxLayout` derives it from the children present - or the centered default when its layout manager
 * derives none. Swing offers no way to hand an alignment back to the layout once one is set, so
 * removing the modifier writes the alignment the layout derives at that moment.
 *
 * Swing keeps to itself whether an alignment was ever set, so an alignment a component does hold is
 * restored only where it differs from the one its layout derives as the declaration attaches. One that
 * matches it is read as none.
 *
 * @param value the fraction of the component's width the parent lines its children up on; Swing clamps a
 *   value outside `0.0..1.0` into that range rather than rejecting it.
 * @return this chain with the horizontal alignment declared on it.
 * @see javax.swing.JComponent.setAlignmentX
