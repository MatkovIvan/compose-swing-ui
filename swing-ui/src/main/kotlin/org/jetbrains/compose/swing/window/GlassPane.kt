/**
 * Declares the glass pane of the window whose content this is composed in.
 *
 * This is declared on [WindowScope], the receiver of the content of a [Window] and of a [Dialog], so it
 * is only available where there is a window to carry the pane.
 *
 * A glass pane is the sheet above everything else in the window: it covers the whole window, it is
 * transparent where [content] paints nothing, and while it is shown the window's mouse events reach it
 * rather than the content underneath - which is what makes it the place for a drag-and-drop hint, a
 * progress veil, or anything else drawn over the window rather than in it. [content] is reached first, so
 * a button in the overlay still gets its clicks while the window behind the pane gets none. [content]
 * fills the pane, so a layout composable inside it places what the overlay is made of:
 *
 * ```
 * Window(onCloseRequest = ::exitApplication) {
 *     if (loading) {
 *         GlassPane {
 *             Panel(PanelLayout.GridBag) {
 *                 item { ProgressBar(value = 0, indeterminate = true) }
 *             }
 *         }
 *     }
 *     Editor()
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The content shares the surrounding composition, so it shows the current state the way any other
 * composable does. The pane is over the window for as long as this is in the composition; once this
 * leaves, the window carries the glass pane it carried before, showing it as it was shown - so an
 * overlay that comes and goes is an ordinary `if` around the call.
 *
 * A window carries one glass pane, so one declaration serves a window: put the choice of overlay inside
 * the declaration rather than composing a second one for the same window, which fails and leaves the
 * window the pane it carried.
 *
 * The same sheet over one decorated component rather than a whole window is
 * [org.jetbrains.compose.swing.components.LayerScope.GlassPane].
 *
 * @param content the composable content the glass pane shows over the window.
 * @see javax.swing.JRootPane.setGlassPane
