 * see `DeferredRegionCheck` for what that turn is worth. Checked mid-pass instead, this would refuse

 * children while a replacement arrives before the child it replaces leaves.

/**
 * Holds every live composed child of this indexed host to being attached to some container -
 * not necessarily this one, and not necessarily where the composition put it. See
 * [indexedChildMissing] for why the check stops there rather than asking whether the child is
 * really under this host.
 *
 * Membership, equality and order are deliberately left unchecked: many a Swing component's own
 * look-and-feel delegate gives it real children of its own - `JComboBox` an arrow button, `JTree` a
 * `CellRendererPane` - that no composable ever declared and the applier never attached, standing
 * alongside whatever this host's `content` composed. And a `JLayeredPane` host does not keep its real
 * children in composition order at all: it sorts them by the layer each one's modifier names, so two
 * composed siblings on different layers can appear in either order among the real children regardless
 * of which was composed first.
 *
 * A deactivated child is skipped: [onDeactivate][SwingNodeHolder] already detached its component, and it
 * stands in [SwingNodeHolder.children] only until the composition removes it for good - see
 * [SwingNodeHolder.deactivated].
 *
 * So is a child standing under some other container, because a component's own look-and-feel may take it
 * out of the host the composition put it in and hold it elsewhere: a floating `JToolBar` is reparented
 * into a window the UI opens and docks back into this same host, so the applier is right to go on holding
 * it here. What is left is the case this check can answer for - the applier says a child is here and the
 * child is nowhere at all.
