 * What one composition owns and every node under it shares.
 *
 * A node takes it from its parent as it is inserted, so it travels the node tree rather than being
 * handed out by the applier - which has no stake in it, and reads what it needs off its own root like
 * any other node. Only the root is attached from outside, by the composition that owns it.
 *
 * A node is attached on the top-down insert pass. That is earlier than the tree it stands in strictly
 * requires, and deliberately so: a node's update block runs between the top-down and bottom-up passes
 * and reads what is here - it is where a snapshot-observing component such as `Canvas` adopts the
 * observer - so an attach left to the bottom-up pass would reach a component already attached and
 * painted, leaving it observing nothing.
 *
 * One owner stands for the whole life of the composition behind it, so what a node reads through it on
 * its first pass is what it reads on every later one.
