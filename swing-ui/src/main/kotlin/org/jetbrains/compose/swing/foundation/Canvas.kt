/**
 * A composable that hands you the raw [Graphics2D] of a blank Swing surface so you can draw whatever
 * you like.
 *
 * **Repaint is snapshot-observed.** Any snapshot state you read *directly inside* [onDraw] is tracked;
 * when such state changes the surface repaints and re-invokes [onDraw] automatically. Read your state
 * where you use it, at paint time:
 *
 * ```
 * var radius by remember { mutableStateOf(10) }
 * Canvas(modifier = SwingModifier.preferredSize(Dimension(200, 200))) { g, width, height ->
 *     g.fillOval(width / 2 - radius, height / 2 - radius, radius * 2, radius * 2)
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The surface is non-opaque and paints no background of its own: only what [onDraw] renders appears.
 * Size it with the preferred-size modifier (see
 * [org.jetbrains.compose.swing.modifier.layout.preferredSize]).
 *
 * @param modifier the [SwingModifier] applied to the underlying component.
 * @param onDraw receives the surface's [Graphics2D] and its current pixel `width`/`height`; called on
 *   the Swing event dispatch thread during painting. Do not retain the [Graphics2D] beyond the call.
 * @see javax.swing.JComponent.paintComponent
