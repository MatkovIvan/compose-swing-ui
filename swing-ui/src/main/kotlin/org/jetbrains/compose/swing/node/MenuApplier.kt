/**
 * Applier for the menu tree: `JMenuBar`/`JMenu`/`JPopupMenu` containers and `JMenuItem`/`JSeparator`
 * leaves, placed by index. Every container a change pass touches is revalidated and repainted once: the
 * applier hands that walk to [ComponentUpdateBatch]. Every popup of the tree that is on screen is packed
 * in [onEndChanges] and once more on the event-queue turn that follows, so a menu open while the pass ran
 * takes the size of what it shows now.
 *
 * Each node keeps its [SwingNodeHolder.children] in composition order, which is the index space the
 * runtime addresses. A parked child stands in that list with its component already detached - the
 * runtime keeps a deactivated group's place while the container no longer holds the item - so the
 * position handed to a container is counted over the siblings actually attached, and a remove or a move
 * addresses each child's component by identity rather than by container index.
 *
 * The root is a [JMenuBar] for a window menu bar, or a [JPopupMenu] for a context menu.
