/**
 * The layout of a [Table]'s columns: which of the model's columns each view position shows, and how wide
 * each of those positions wants to be.
 *
 * [modelIndices] holds the model index of every view column, left to right, so it describes the order the
 * columns are in - reordering columns permutes it while the model behind them stays as it is.
 * [preferredWidths] holds the matching width of each view column, in the same order, so the two lists have
 * one entry each per view column. The width is the *preferred* width because that is the one a resize
 * leaves behind: a table spreads the space it has across its columns in proportion to their preferred
 * widths at every layout pass, so an exact width lasts only until the next one.
 *
 * @property modelIndices the model index of each view column, left to right
 * @property preferredWidths the preferred width in pixels of each view column, left to right
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the two lists are of different sizes
 * @see javax.swing.table.TableColumnModel
 * @see javax.swing.table.TableColumn.setPreferredWidth
