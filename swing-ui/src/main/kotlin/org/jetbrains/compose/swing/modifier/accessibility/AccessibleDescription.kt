/**
 * Sets the component's accessible description - a longer localized explanation assistive technologies
 * can read after the name. `null` clears any description this modifier set.
 *
 * A component holds no description of its own until one is set: its accessible context derives one
 * instead, from the tooltip or from the caption labeling it. Removing this modifier restores that
 * derivation, not the string it derived. A description the component was built carrying is its own, and
 * is restored as such. A description an accessible context cannot tell from the derived one is
 * restored by derivation.
 *
 * @param description the accessible description to advertise, or `null` to clear it.
 * @return this modifier with the accessible description declared on it.
