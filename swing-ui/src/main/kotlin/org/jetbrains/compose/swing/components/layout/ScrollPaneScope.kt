/**
 * The receiver of a [ScrollPane]'s content, through which a child declares the region of the pane it is
 * installed in.
 *
 * Children are written plainly; the region a child declares here rides along on its `modifier`:
 *
 * ```
 * ScrollPane {
 *     Column(modifier = SwingModifier.viewport()) { Rows() }
 *     Label(text = "Rows", modifier = SwingModifier.rowHeader())
 *     Label(text = "*", modifier = SwingModifier.corner(JScrollPane.UPPER_TRAILING_CORNER))
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The regions are the viewport, the row header, the column header and each of the four corners. A pane
 * holds nothing besides them, so every child names one and a child that names none is refused, naming
 * the pane and the builders that would place it. Each region becomes the single view of the
 * corresponding `JViewport` or the single child of a corner host, so it shows one component and two
 * children naming the same region are refused too; the four corners are four regions, so two children
 * in different corners are two children in their own regions. A child that goes away releases the
 * region it held.
