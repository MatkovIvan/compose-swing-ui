     * A widget notifies its listeners from inside the write that provokes them, so a listener the caller

     * would end the composition for good. A caught failure is reported the way Swing reports one raised
     * on its own event pump, and the pass finishes.
     *
     * Every throwable is caught: what a listener throws is the caller's choice, and naming only some
     * types would leave the rest free to end the composition.
     *
     * Inlined, so a write a settle makes carries no block of its own.
