/**
 * A `JProgressBar` reporting how far along a task is: it fills in proportion to where [value] stands
 * between [min] and [max]. The user changes nothing here - the bar renders what the composition
 * declares and reports nothing back.
 *
 * @param value the current value
 * @param modifier the [SwingModifier] applied to the underlying component
 * @param min the value an empty bar stands at; `0` by default
 * @param max the value a full bar stands at; `100` by default, so an undeclared range makes [value] a
 *   percentage
 * @param indeterminate whether the bar animates constantly instead of filling to [value]; `false` by
 *   default. Declare `true` for work whose length is not known yet, and go back to `false` once it is
 * @param orientation the orientation of the progress bar (an [Orientation] `SwingConstants` value);
 *   `HORIZONTAL` by default, which grows the filled part along the bar's width
 * @param stringPainted whether the bar paints text over itself; `false` by default
 * @param string the text painted over the bar; `null` by default, which leaves the bar to paint the
 *   completion percentage, so [stringPainted] on its own gives a percentage readout

 * installs it on recomposition.
 *
 * This is what lets one range drive several widgets - a [Slider] the user moves and the bar reading it out,
 * or two views of the same progress - since each of them renders the model as-is:
 *
 * ```
 * val range = remember { DefaultBoundedRangeModel(30, 0, 0, 100) }
 * Slider(model = range)
 * ProgressBar(model = range)
