 * top-level host (a window, dialog, or tray icon) hosts its content through a child composition
 * without launching such a coroutine itself, so this parked effect is the host's reason to keep the
 * application open: it stays suspended until the host leaves the composition, at which point its
 * cancellation lets the application exit.
