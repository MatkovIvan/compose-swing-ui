/**
 * A strip of items - buttons, toggles, separators - the user reaches without opening a menu, held by a
 * `JToolBar`. The bar holds whether it stands docked or in a window of its own, and reports the drags
 * that move it between the two.
 *
 * The items declared in [content] become the tool bar's children in declaration order:
 * ```
 * ToolBar {
 *     Button(text = "New", onClick = { ... })
 *     ToolBarSeparator()
 *     Button(text = "Open", onClick = { ... })
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * A [Glue] among the items pushes the ones after it to the trailing end, which is how a tool bar gets
 * a trailing group.
 *
 * A floatable bar can be dragged out into a window of its own. [floating] is a two-way state: it puts the
 * bar into its own window or brings it back, and [onFloatingChange] reports the state the user drags the
 * bar into or docks it back to. Floating needs a window to open the bar's own beside, and a bar whose
 * look and feel gives it no dragging, whose [floatable] is `false`, or that is not in a window yet has
 * none to open. Where the bar cannot take the declaration it stays docked, and [onFloatingChange] is
 * handed that answer; a bar that comes to stand in a window later takes the standing declaration then.
 * A drag the caller does not answer with a matching [floating] is settled back, so the bar returns to
 * the state the composition declares.
 *
 * A bar docked back from its window, or dropped onto another edge of its container, returns to the
 * region its [modifier] declares, but not to its place among the container's other children: the look
 * and feel's dock adds the bar at the end of them, and it stays there, in z-order and in focus
 * traversal order. A look and feel turns a bar it docks on a side edge to face along that edge, and it
 * is turned back to the [orientation] declared.
 *
 * A floating bar is held by that window instead of the container it was declared in, and its items keep
 * composing there. The composition still counts the bar among the children of the container it left, so
 * declare a floating bar's siblings - and the bar itself - while it is docked. A bar that leaves the
 * composition while floating takes its window with it.
 *
 * @param modifier the [SwingModifier] applied to the underlying `JToolBar`
 * @param orientation the axis along which items are laid out (an [Orientation] `SwingConstants` value);
 *   the default `HORIZONTAL` lays them out along the bar's reading order
 * @param floatable whether the user can drag the tool bar out into a window of its own, and, while it
 *   is docked, to another edge of the container holding it, or `null` to leave the choice the bar
 *   already carries, which a bar carries as draggable; a look and feel that implements no floating
 *   ignores it. A bar the user can drag out has to stand in a container laid out by a `BorderLayout` -
 *   a panel under [PanelLayout.Border], or a window's own content - which is the only place a look and
 *   feel docks it back
 *   into the region it came from; anywhere else the bar is refused as it is composed, so declare
 *   `false` there
 * @param floating whether the tool bar stands in a window of its own rather than in the container it was
 *   declared in (controlled); `false` by default, so the bar starts docked where it was declared
 * @param onFloatingChange callback invoked with the state the user drags the bar into, or with the docked
 *   state the bar settles for when it cannot take [floating]
 * @param rollover whether the look and feel draws an item's border only while the pointer is over it,
 *   or `null` to leave the choice to it; a choice withdrawn after being declared settles at its answer
 *   for good, and a look and feel may ignore the request
 * @param content the items hosted by the tool bar; empty by default
 * @see javax.swing.JToolBar
