 * [bound] - a spinner's [name] - in the class of [value]. The model holds each bound as a `Comparable`,
 * and a concrete `Number` compares against its own class alone, so a bound left in another class throws
 * a `ClassCastException` out of the model, at construction or on the first step taken against it.
 *
 * A `BigInteger` or `BigDecimal` value is refused a bound outright: the model steps such a value by
 * boxing the sum as a `Byte`, which no bound of the value's own class can be compared against either.
 *
 * The conversion must be exact. A bound the value's class cannot hold is not the bound that was declared,
 * so it is refused rather than rounded into one the spinner would silently honor instead.

 * the shortest decimal that round-trips it, so `0.1f` is carried into a `Double` as the number the `Float`
 * held, and the `Double` `0.1` - which no `Float` holds - is refused rather than narrowed. Exactness is
 * asked of `BigDecimal` through `compareTo`, since its own equality counts scale and holds `0.0` and `0`
 * to be different numbers.
 *
 * An infinite or `NaN` bound has no decimal to judge: a `Float` and a `Double` each hold either exactly,
