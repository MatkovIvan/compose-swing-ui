/**
 * The [androidx.compose.runtime.Applier] that [org.jetbrains.compose.swing.node.SwingNode] emits into, mutating
 * the Swing component tree as the composition changes.
 *
 * Construct one over a root node already attached to the surrounding composition, and hand it to a
 * `Composition` to host Compose-Swing content at the applier level; the everyday entry points are the
 * `setContent` functions, which build both internally. See `docs/CUSTOM-COMPONENTS.md` and
 * `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
 *
 * Placement of each child:
 * - Every host node declares how it holds its children, as its [SwingNodeHolder.childPlacement]. Under
 *   [ChildPlacement.Indexed] children are added to the container by index and no child may name a region
 *   of the host; under [ChildPlacement.Slots] and [ChildPlacement.OrderedSlots] every child names one,
 *   and a child that does not match the host's declaration is refused, naming the host and the calls that
 *   would place it.
 * - A child the composition relocates - `movableContent` invoked under another parent - reaches its new
 *   host before its own modifier chain has run there, so it is taken into that host's children as it
 *   arrives and attached once the change pass has settled, under the placement its chain names at the
 *   host it is at now. That is also where such a child is held to the host's declaration.
 * - An indexed child is added with its declared [SwingNodeHolder.constraint] when non-null (e.g. a
 *   `BorderLayout` region), otherwise by index alone. The constraint is the one the child's own modifier
 *   chain declares.
 * - A child naming a region carries the [SwingNodeHolder.declaredSlot] that fills it. The child
 *   is installed into its host through that attachment's dedicated Swing setter and uninstalled the same
 *   way on removal, so the region is released. A child whose chain comes to name another region is moved
 *   between the two the same way, and one that stops naming a region is released from the one it fills
 *   and then refused, the way a child arriving at a region-holding host without one is. A
 *   [ChildPlacement.Slots] host shows one component per region, which is checked once the change pass has
 *   settled - a pass that replaces the occupant of a region need not take the outgoing child out before
 *   the incoming one arrives.
 * - The composition's own top-level children are the one case no composable declares: a [rootSlot]
 *   installs each of them into a region of [root], reached through a setter of its owner rather than by
 *   `Container.add`, and [root] shows the one top-level component that region holds - checked the way
 *   every other single-occupancy host is.
 *
 * Every container mutated during a change pass is revalidated and repainted once, by [ComponentUpdateBatch].
 *
 * Internal implementation type; not public API.
 *
 * @param root the node this composition is rooted at, attached to the composition that owns it.
 * @param rootSlot installs the children composed directly under [root], which then shows the single
 *   top-level component that slot holds; `null` - the default - adds them to [root] by index.
 * @see org.jetbrains.compose.swing.node.SwingNode
