/**
 * The debug-only checks the compositions on one recomposer are held to, installed as an element of the
 * coroutine context that recomposer was built over.
 *
 * A composition reads it as it is mounted, and one nested under it reads the same element through its
 * parent's effect context - a cell renderer's composition, a menu's, a window's. Nothing installs one in
 * production.
 *
 * Every call runs on the event dispatch thread, from inside the change pass that provoked it. A violation
 * is reported rather than thrown: a throw from inside a modifier write reaches the apply phase and ends
 * the recomposer for good.
 *
 * Marked [InternalSwingUiApi]; it may change or be removed without notice in any release.
