/**
 * A lazy handle to the single component targeted by a query. The target is resolved against the
 * live AWT tree each time it is needed, so it always reflects the current tree after recomposition.
 *
 * [T] is the component type the query names: `onNodeOfType<JTable>()` targets a `JTable`, and every
 * step that keeps targeting the same node keeps that type, so [fetch] returns it without being told
 * it again. A query that names no type - `onNodeWithText`, `onNodeWithTag`, [onParent] - targets a
 * [Component], and a narrower type is named at the [fetch] that needs it.
 *
 * All methods are intended to be called from a [org.jetbrains.compose.swing.test.runComposeSwingTest]
 * body, which runs on the EDT.
 * Resolution fails with a readable tree dump when the query does not resolve to a single component.
