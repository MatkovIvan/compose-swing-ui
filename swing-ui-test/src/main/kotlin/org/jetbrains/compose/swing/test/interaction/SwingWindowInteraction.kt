/**
 * A lazy handle to the single top-level window targeted by a window query. The target is resolved
 * against the live set of realized windows each time it is needed, so it always reflects windows
 * appearing and disappearing across recomposition.
 *
 * A window matches while its native peer is realized, whether or not it is currently shown, so a
 * window declared `visible = false` is still matched. A window that leaves the composition is disposed,
 * which retires its peer and drops it out of the match set; a disposed peer lingering in the global AWT
 * window list is likewise excluded because it is no longer realized.
 *
 * Beyond asserting on the window itself, the interaction scopes node queries to that window's
 * content pane, so a test can assert on the content of each top-level peer independently:
 *
 * ```
 * onWindowWithTitle("Settings").onNodeWithText("Apply").assertIsEnabled()
 * ```
 *
 * All methods are intended to be called from a [org.jetbrains.compose.swing.test.runSwingUiTest]
 * body, which runs on the EDT.
