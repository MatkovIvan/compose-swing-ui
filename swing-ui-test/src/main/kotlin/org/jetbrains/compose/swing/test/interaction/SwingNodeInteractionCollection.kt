/**
 * A lazy handle to the set of components matched by a query. The match set is resolved against the
 * live AWT tree each time it is needed, so it reflects the current tree.
 *
 * [T] is the component type the query names - `onAllNodesOfType<JLabel>()` matches `JLabel`s - and
 * every step that keeps matching the same set keeps it, so [fetchAll] and the single-node handles
 * [get], [onFirst], [onLast] and [filterToOne] carry it on. A query that names no type matches
 * [Component]s.
 *
 * All methods are intended to be called from a [org.jetbrains.compose.swing.test.runComposeSwingTest]
 * body, which runs on the EDT.
