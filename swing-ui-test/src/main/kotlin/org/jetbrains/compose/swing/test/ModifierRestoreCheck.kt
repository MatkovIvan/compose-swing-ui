/**
 * Holds every modifier write to putting back what it overwrote: once every slot that wrote a property
 * has left, the property stands where the component's modifier found it.
 *
 * What a write lands on is learned by reading the component around it, never by naming properties: a
 * write reaches more than the property its slot declares - a coarse geometry covers each axis, a look
 * and feel answering a setter re-derives a font - and a check naming what it expects would be blind to
 * exactly the property a new builder forgets to name. Only the properties a declaration names for
 * itself - its [SwingModifier.NodeElement.heldProperties] - are taken on its word. The properties read
 * are the ones [comparedPropertiesOf] names.
 *
 * [report] is handed one failure per departing slot, naming every property that slot left where the
 * modifier did not find it.
 *
 * Each slot is held to what its element's [SwingModifier.NodeElement.restores] undertakes.
 * [RestorePolicy.None] answers for nothing of its own on the way out, and
 * [RestorePolicy.DeclaredPropertyOnly] for the one property the element declares. What such an element
 * writes is recorded like any other write, so a property it goes on declaring is not owed by a slot
 * leaving beside it.
