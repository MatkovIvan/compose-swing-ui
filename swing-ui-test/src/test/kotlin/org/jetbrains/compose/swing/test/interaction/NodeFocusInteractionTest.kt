/**
 * Pins what the harness's focus actions deliver and what its focus-ownership assertions claim.
 *
 * Focus splits into two things off-screen, and the tests below hold them apart. A focus notification
 * reaches the node itself, so behavior a widget drives from `processFocusEvent` is observable without a
 * display. Focus ownership is held by a component of the focused window, so nothing under the harness
 * root ever holds it, and a component of a window the composition realizes holds it once the window
 * system focuses that window - the one situation in which the ownership assertion can hold.
