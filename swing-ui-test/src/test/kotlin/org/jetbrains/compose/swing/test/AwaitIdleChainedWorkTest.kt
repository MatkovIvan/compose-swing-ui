/**
 * Proves [SwingUiTest.awaitIdle] awaits chained EDT-deferred work, not just a fixed number of drains.
 *
 * The idle gate settles the composition and then drains the event-dispatch queue until it is
 * genuinely empty. A task run by one drain may schedule further `invokeLater` work, and the final
 * link in such a chain may mutate observable state or a composition input. Draining a fixed one or
 * two turns would declare idleness with that scheduled work still queued, so these cases build chains
 * deeper than any fixed count and assert that the final effect has landed by the time `awaitIdle`
 * returns.
