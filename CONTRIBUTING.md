# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to Compose Swing UI. This guide covers how to build and test the project,
the quality gates every change must pass, and the code style.

## Prerequisites

- **JDK 21.** The Kotlin toolchain and detekt are pinned to JVM 21; CI runs on JDK 21. (The Foojay
  toolchain plugin can download a matching JDK automatically.)
- Use the Gradle wrapper (`./gradlew`). Do not rely on a system Gradle.

## Build and test

```bash
# Full build: compile, run all gates and tests
./gradlew build

# Tests only
./gradlew test

# Run a sample application
./gradlew :samples:todo-app:run
./gradlew :samples:widgets-gallery:run
```

Tests run **headless** and deterministically — they never realize an on-screen window and never
sleep. Write UI tests with the `:swing-ui-test` harness:

```kotlin
@Test
fun clickingTheButtonUpdatesTheLabel() = runSwingUiTest {
    var clicks by mutableStateOf(0)
    setContent {
        Button(text = "Clicks: $clicks", onClick = { clicks++ })
    }
    onNodeWithText("Clicks: 0").performClick()
    onNodeWithText("Clicks: 1").assertExists()
}
```

Prefer `setContent { … }` followed by assertions; `setContent` waits for the composition to settle
for you. Reach for `waitUntil { … }` only when a condition genuinely depends on external timing. See
[`docs/TESTING-COMPONENTS.md`](docs/TESTING-COMPONENTS.md) for the full harness guide.

## Quality gates (all must pass)

CI runs exactly this, so run the same locally before pushing:

```bash
./gradlew build checkKotlinAbi ktlintCheck detekt test :buildSrc:ktlintCheck :buildSrc:detekt
```

Piece by piece:

- **`ktlintCheck`** — formatting + lint, including Compose-aware rules
  (`io.nlopez.compose.rules`). Auto-fix with:
  ```bash
  ./gradlew ktlintFormat
  ```
- **`detekt`** — static analysis (`config/detekt/detekt.yml`, on top of the default config).
- **`checkKotlinAbi`** — the Kotlin Gradle plugin's built-in ABI validation. If you change the
  **public API**, regenerate the committed `.api` files and review the diff:
  ```bash
  ./gradlew updateKotlinAbi
  ```
  Commit the updated `swing-ui/api/swing-ui.api` (and `swing-ui-test/api/swing-ui-test.api` if the
  test module's surface changed). A public-API change should be intentional and reviewed.
- **`:buildSrc:ktlintCheck` / `:buildSrc:detekt`** — `buildSrc` is an included build, so the
  root-level gates do **not** reach it; these must be invoked explicitly (CI does). Run them
  whenever you touch the convention plugins under `buildSrc/`.
- **`:swing-ui:jacocoTestCoverageVerification`** — `swing-ui` enforces a per-module line-coverage
  floor: a change that drops coverage below the floor fails the build. The floor covers code the
  headless test suite can exercise. Add tests for any new behavior you can reach through the test
  harness.

## Code style

- **Explicit API mode is on** for the library modules. Every public declaration needs an explicit
  visibility modifier and an explicit return type. Keep helpers `internal` rather than widening
  visibility to make something reachable.
- **KDoc every public declaration.** Document parameters and behavior, especially any threading
  (EDT) or lifecycle requirements. KDoc is the API catalog; documentation prose links out to it
  rather than re-listing the API.
- **Stay on the EDT.** Composition entry points and component mutations run on the Event Dispatch
  Thread. Use `Dispatchers.Swing` for coroutines that touch Swing.
- **Match the surrounding style.** Trailing commas, import ordering, and formatting are enforced by
  ktlint — run `ktlintFormat` rather than hand-tuning.

### Composable target

Every Swing composable — each component, layout, and menu function, plus `setContent` and
`SwingNode` and their `content`/slot lambdas — carries `@SwingComposable` alongside `@Composable`.
This keeps the Swing applier target distinct from `compose.ui`'s `@UiComposable`, so mixing a Swing
composable with a `compose.ui` composable (in either direction) is a compile-time error rather than
a runtime failure. Any new public composable, and any custom component you author, must carry
`@SwingComposable` too (and annotate its `content` lambda as `@Composable @SwingComposable`).

### Typed constants

Model a closed set of named JDK/Swing integer constants (a selection mode, a placement, a message
kind) as a `@MagicConstant`-annotated typedef — never an `enum class` and never a wrapper value class.
Declare an annotation class whose only job is to name the accepted constants, then use it as
`@Xxx Int` on the parameter; the value passed at runtime stays the **plain JDK constant** the wrapped
Swing API already expects, so there is no boxing, accessor, or translation layer:

```kotlin
@Retention(AnnotationRetention.BINARY)
@MagicConstant(
    intValues = [
        JScrollPane.VERTICAL_SCROLLBAR_AS_NEEDED.toLong(),
        JScrollPane.VERTICAL_SCROLLBAR_ALWAYS.toLong(),
        JScrollPane.VERTICAL_SCROLLBAR_NEVER.toLong(),
    ],
)
public annotation class VerticalScrollbarPolicy

// call site passes the plain JDK constant; the IDE flags anything outside the set
public fun ScrollPane(
    @VerticalScrollbarPolicy verticalScrollbar: Int = JScrollPane.VERTICAL_SCROLLBAR_AS_NEEDED,
    /* … */
)
```

Retention is **`BINARY`** so the annotation survives into the compiled class files and the IDE's
MagicConstant inspection can read it across the published-jar boundary — warning consumers in their
own IDE — while `org.jetbrains:annotations` stays a `compileOnly` dependency that never reaches the
runtime classpath. A constant string set (e.g. a MIME content type) uses `stringValues` instead of
`intValues`. When the same value lives in more than one Swing namespace (e.g. `SwingConstants` vs.
`FlowLayout` alignments), declare a distinct annotation per namespace so each names exactly its own
constants. Group a new typedef alongside the library's other typed constant sets.

## Adding a new component

A component is a `@Composable` function that emits a `SwingNode`: the `factory` builds the backing
Swing component once, `update` reactively pushes state onto it via `set` blocks, and a
`modifier: SwingModifier = SwingModifier` parameter carries caller styling. Domain callbacks
(`onClick`, `onValueChange`) stay ordinary parameters; install reactive listeners through the
`SwingModifier` listener builders so the runtime owns their lifecycle.

[`docs/CUSTOM-COMPONENTS.md`](docs/CUSTOM-COMPONENTS.md) is the authoritative, worked guide to all of
this — it applies equally to library components and to components you build in your own app. Follow
it, then:

- Add a behavioral test under `swing-ui/src/test` exercising state → recomposition → visible change
  (and listener re-attach if relevant). Library tests use the `:swing-ui-test` harness, available as
  `testImplementation`.
- Run `./gradlew updateKotlinAbi` and commit the updated `.api`, since a new public component changes
  the surface.
- Run the full gate command above before opening a PR.
