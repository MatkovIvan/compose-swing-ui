# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to Compose Swing UI. This guide covers how to build and test the project,
the quality gates every change must pass, and the code style.

## Prerequisites

- **JDK 21 or newer.** `buildSrc` compiles to JVM 21 and the build provisions no toolchain, so the
  JDK you run on is the one it uses. Published library binaries target Java 11 regardless.
- Use the Gradle wrapper (`./gradlew`). Do not rely on a system Gradle.

## Build and test

```bash
# Full build: compile, run all gates and tests
./gradlew build

# Tests only
./gradlew test

# One module, or one test class, while iterating
./gradlew :swing-ui:test
./gradlew :swing-ui:test --tests '*ComboBoxEditableTest*'

# The tests that need the window system to itself (focus, minimization)
./gradlew :swing-ui:exclusiveWindowSystemTest

# Run a sample application
./gradlew :samples:todo-app:run
./gradlew :samples:widgets-gallery:run

# API reference for every published module, one site at build/dokka/html
./gradlew :dokkaGenerate
```

Compiling a module also writes the Compose compiler's reports - which composables are skippable, and
which parameters are unstable - to `<module>/build/compose-reports`, alongside summary counts in
`<module>/build/compose-metrics`. A build that is up to date or served from the cache does not
compile and leaves the reports it finds, so force compilation when you need to trust them. Kotlin's
incremental compiler recompiles only the sources a change touches, and the report reflects only that
increment - a short or empty report means little was recompiled, not that the module has nothing
unstable. Only a non-incremental compile produces a report covering the whole module:
`./gradlew --rerun-tasks :swing-ui:compileKotlin`, or clean the module first.

`:swing-ui` splits its suite across two tasks, and `check` runs both. `test` holds everything that
asserts nothing about which window the window system is attending to, and runs it across parallel
JVMs; `exclusiveWindowSystemTest` holds the classes tagged `ExclusiveWindowSystem` - those asserting
on focus or minimization - and runs them one at a time, because two of them at once take that state
from each other and skip. Write a new test into whichever it belongs to by tagging the class, not by
where the file sits. Note that a scoped `:swing-ui:test` run also pulls in
`exclusiveWindowSystemTest`, which the coverage report that follows a test run depends on.

Scope a run while iterating; `./gradlew test` runs every module's suite. The modules test each other:
`:swing-ui-test` publishes the harness that `:swing-ui`'s own tests are written against, so a harness
change is exercised far more by the library's suite than by the harness's own, and both samples' tests
sit downstream of the two. A scoped run belongs to the edit loop; the gate below is what a change is
judged by.

Harness-driven tests are deterministic, never sleep, and never attach their root to a window, so
they run with or without a display. Only a wait on something the composition does not drive - the
window system, or a quiet period that proves nothing happened - polls against a real deadline. A test
that realizes a real top-level peer gates itself with
`assumeFalse(GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless(), ...)` so it reports skipped without one, and others
gate the same way on a capability the environment may withhold. A run with no
failures is therefore not necessarily a complete one: the ignored count in
`<module>/build/reports/tests/test/index.html` says what did not run. CI runs under a virtual
framebuffer, so the display-gated tests skipped here run and are judged there too; only the ones
gated on a capability the framebuffer itself lacks (see Quality gates below) still report skipped in
CI.

See [`docs/TESTING-COMPONENTS.md`](docs/TESTING-COMPONENTS.md) for the harness guide.

## Quality gates (all must pass)

`build` runs every module's `check` - compilation, ktlint, detekt, the Compose lint checks, tests,
the coverage gates and `checkKotlinAbi` - plus `assemble`. Which of those a module carries depends on
the convention plugins it applies: the vendored `swing-ui-animation` fork is exempt from ktlint,
detekt and the lint checks, and `samples/docs`, which holds generated code, carries none of them
beyond compilation. One gate sits outside `build`: `buildSrc` is an included build the
root-level tasks do not reach. So the full gate is two commands, and they are what to run locally
before pushing:

```bash
./gradlew :buildSrc:ktlintCheck :buildSrc:detekt
./gradlew build
```

CI runs the same two - the second on a display a virtual framebuffer supplies, so tests that realize a
real top-level window run instead of skipping - and then `publishToMavenLocal` to check that the
publishing configuration still resolves. Nothing manages that display, and the toolkit answers for the
capabilities of whatever does, so the tests that need maximizing, always-on-top or a system tray gate
themselves on the capability and report as skipped there.

Piece by piece:

- **`ktlintCheck`** - formatting + lint. Auto-fix with:
  ```bash
  ./gradlew ktlintFormat
  ```
- **`detekt`** - static analysis (`config/detekt/detekt.yml`, on top of the default config). The gate
  runs it through `check`, which wires the type-resolution variants, `detektMain` and `detektTest`;
  rules that need the compile classpath only fire there. When scoping a run to one module while
  iterating, invoke `:module:detektMain` and `:module:detektTest` rather than the plain
  `:module:detekt` task, which runs without type resolution and stays silent on those rules. This
  does not apply to `buildSrc`, whose plain `detekt` task (below) is its own gate.
- **`checkKotlinAbi`** - the Kotlin Gradle plugin's built-in ABI validation, comparing the compiled
  surface against the committed `.api` dumps. If you change the **public API**, regenerate them and
  review the diff:
  ```bash
  ./gradlew updateKotlinAbi
  ```
  Commit whichever of `swing-ui/api/swing-ui.api`, `swing-ui-detekt/api/swing-ui-detekt.api`,
  `swing-ui-test/api/swing-ui-test.api` and `swing-ui-animation/api/swing-ui-animation.api` the change
  moved. A public-API change should be intentional and reviewed.
- **`:buildSrc:ktlintCheck` / `:buildSrc:detekt`** - formatting, lint and static analysis for the
  convention plugins. Run them whenever you touch anything under `buildSrc/`.
- **`jacocoTestCoverageVerification`** - `swing-ui`, `swing-ui-detekt`, `swing-ui-test` and `swing-ui-animation` each
  enforce a line-coverage floor and a branch-coverage floor, measured per module against that
  module's own tests. A change that drops a ratio below its floor fails the build. Add tests for any
  new behavior you can reach through the test harness. The floors are held, not chased: if a branch is
  a defensive guard with no reachable behavior, leave it uncovered rather than writing a test that
  asserts nothing.

## Documentation snippets

Kotlin snippets in `README.md` and `docs/` are compiled by the build, and marking one is opt-in:
write `<!--- KNIT example-<document>-01.kt -->` on its own line after the closing fence, and Knit
merges the block into a file under `samples/docs/build/generated/knit/example/`, taking the number
from the document's own sequence. A snippet that is a fragment rather than a whole file gets its
imports and its enclosing function from an `INCLUDE`/`SUFFIX` preamble at the top of the document,
matched against the example file name; an unmarked block is followed by `<!--- CLEAR -->` so it does
not merge into the next marked one.

The generated files are a build output, not source: nothing under that directory is committed, and
there is nothing to regenerate by hand. `build` writes them and compiles them, so a snippet that
does not compile fails the build. While editing a document, the quick check is:

```bash
./gradlew :samples:docs:compileKotlin
```

Renaming or deleting a marked snippet leaves the file it used to generate behind in the build
directory, where it keeps compiling. Run `./gradlew :samples:docs:clean` after such a change to get
the same result a fresh checkout gets.

## Code style

- **Explicit API mode is on** for the library modules. Every public declaration needs an explicit
  visibility modifier and an explicit return type. Keep helpers `internal` rather than widening
  visibility to make something reachable.
- **KDoc every public declaration.** Document parameters and behavior, especially any threading
  (EDT) or lifecycle requirements. KDoc is the API catalog; documentation prose links out to it
  rather than re-listing the API.
- **Stay on the EDT.** Composition entry points and component mutations run on the Event Dispatch
  Thread. Use `Dispatchers.Swing` for coroutines that touch Swing.
- **Match the surrounding style.** Trailing commas, import ordering, and formatting are enforced by
  ktlint - run `ktlintFormat` rather than hand-tuning.
- **Pass arguments in the order the component declares them.** A named argument may sit anywhere, but
  a call that lists them out of order has to be read against the signature one name at a time to see
  what was passed and what was left defaulted. Write `Button("Save", onClick = ::save, modifier = m)`,
  not `Button("Save", modifier = m, onClick = ::save)`.

### Composable target

`@SwingComposable` (or `@SwingMenuComposable` for a menu) belongs on `SwingNode`, the menu-tree
primitives, `setContent`, and a `content`/slot lambda **parameter** forwarded to one of them by value -
not on an ordinary component or container. See
[`docs/CUSTOM-COMPONENTS.md`](docs/CUSTOM-COMPONENTS.md) for the full explanation.

### Typed constants

Model a closed set of named JDK/Swing integer constants (a selection mode, a placement, a message
kind) as a `@MagicConstant`-annotated typedef - never an `enum class` and never a wrapper value class.
Declare an annotation class whose only job is to name the accepted constants, then use it as
`@Xxx Int` on the parameter (see [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for what a typed
constant set gives a caller):

```kotlin
@Retention(AnnotationRetention.BINARY)
@MagicConstant(
    intValues = [
        JScrollPane.VERTICAL_SCROLLBAR_AS_NEEDED.toLong(),
        JScrollPane.VERTICAL_SCROLLBAR_ALWAYS.toLong(),
        JScrollPane.VERTICAL_SCROLLBAR_NEVER.toLong(),
    ],
)
public annotation class VerticalScrollbarPolicy

// call site passes the plain JDK constant; the IDE flags anything outside the set
public fun ScrollPane(
    /* ... */
    @VerticalScrollbarPolicy verticalScrollbar: Int = JScrollPane.VERTICAL_SCROLLBAR_AS_NEEDED,
    /* ... */
)
```

Retention is **`BINARY`** so the annotation survives into the compiled class files, and the IDE's
MagicConstant inspection can read it across the published-jar boundary - warning consumers in their
own IDE - while `org.jetbrains:annotations` stays a `compileOnly` dependency that never reaches the
runtime classpath. A constant string set (e.g. a MIME content type) uses `stringValues` instead of
`intValues`. When the same value lives in more than one Swing namespace (e.g. `SwingConstants` vs.
`FlowLayout` alignments), declare a distinct annotation per namespace so each names exactly its own
constants. Group a new typedef alongside the library's other typed constant sets.

## Adding a new component

[`docs/CUSTOM-COMPONENTS.md`](docs/CUSTOM-COMPONENTS.md) is the authoritative, worked guide to writing
a component - it applies equally to library components and to components you build in your own app.
Follow it, then:

- Add a behavioral test under `swing-ui/src/test` exercising state -> recomposition -> visible change
  (and listener re-attach if relevant). Library tests use the `:swing-ui-test` harness, available as
  `testImplementation`.
- Run `./gradlew updateKotlinAbi` and commit the updated `.api`, since a new public component changes
  the surface.
- Run the full gate command above before opening a PR.
