# State a component shares with its user

A Swing widget the user can change is a second writer of its own properties. This document is how a
component of your own keeps such a property in step with what the composition declares, and how to
carry state that a declared value with a callback beside it cannot. Building the component itself is
[`CUSTOM-COMPONENTS.md`](CUSTOM-COMPONENTS.md).

## Properties the user can also change

`set` and `update` both assume the composition is the property's only writer. Some widget properties have
a second writer: the widget itself, through the user's own interaction - a checkbox the user clicks, a
divider the user drags, a selection the user picks. For those, what the composition declares and what the
widget currently holds can diverge at any moment, and neither `set` nor `update` notices - a declaration
that repeats the value it declared last pass is skipped, so the widget stays wherever the user left it.

### The mechanism

These pieces work together. For why settling works this way, see
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md).

- `rememberMirrorState(declared)` remembers a `MirrorState<V>` seeded with the first declaration. It is
  a `State<V>` mirroring what the widget currently holds, so reading `mirror.value` while composing
  subscribes to the user changing the widget. Where a body needs that subscription but not the value,
  call `mirror.subscribe()` instead of reading a value it discards.
- `mirror.report(published) { ... }` is called from the widget's own listener with the value the widget
  just published. It updates the mirror, runs the block for a change the user made - not for a value
  that only arrived because the wrapper's own write to the widget just produced it - and then settles the
  composition on the caller's answer. See *When a change settles* below for which changes are reported.
- `mirror.observed(published)` is the same without the settling: it updates the mirror and answers
  whether the change is news, leaving the pass to arrive from the event queue a few cycles later. Use it
  where settling inside the event would be wrong - see below. Call it for every value the widget
  publishes, in the order it publishes them.
- `mirror.report { ... }` - the one-argument form, taking no value - runs the block and settles for a
  change `observed` already took on an earlier channel.
- `declare(value, mirror, read, write)` in the `update` block settles the widget on `value`: it writes
  through `mirror` wherever `read()` does not already answer with it, and keeps the mirror in step with
  whatever the widget ends up holding. Unlike `set`, it runs again on the pass that follows a change
  away from the declaration.
- `declare` also takes a `write` of two arguments, `(held, declared)`, where assigning the whole value
  would destroy what the rest of it anchors: writing a document's text moves the caret to its end, so a
  text component writes back only the span that changed. `held` is what the settlement already read, so
  that write costs no second read.
- `mirror.settle { ... }` is for a write the widget does not simply accept. Installing a row filter makes
  a table drop the selected rows it hides. Declaring a tree's open nodes and its selection separately
  lets the tree resolve the pair its own way, since a node is only selectable while its ancestors are
  open. In both, what the widget ends up holding is not what you wrote, and `declare` cannot see it: it
  reads back only the one property it wrote. So wrap the write yourself and say what the widget was left
  holding - `answered(value)` for a value you read back, or `unchanged()` where this property did not
  move. Saying neither throws. Say nothing at all and the mirror goes on claiming the widget holds what
  you asked for: the next pass finds no difference, nothing puts the declaration back, and the user's own
  change to that property is never reported.

### When a change settles

`report` gets the declaration back on the widget before the repaint that change asked for is served, and
the caller's block runs first.

Report a discrete interaction that way: a click, a selection, a step. Two kinds of change should use
`observed` instead:

- **A continuous gesture** - a drag, a resize. It reports a change per step, and the value one step lands
  on is replaced by the next well inside a display refresh interval, so there is nothing visible to
  correct and batching the steps is worth more than the pass.
- **A change mirrored on one channel and reported on another.** A toggle publishes an item event before
  it publishes its action event, so a mirror riding the item channel has already recorded the change by
  the time the action channel reports it. Settling on the earlier channel would put the declaration back
  before the caller heard about the change at all. Mirror there with `observed`, and settle on the
  reporting channel: `actionListener<JToggleButton> { mirror.report { onSelectedChange(isSelected) } }`.

Neither choice leaves a change the user makes showing before it is settled: the runtime listens for the
events a declared value changes on - key, mouse, motion, input method, and the focus loss a formatted
field commits its text on - and queues its frame ahead of the repaint the change provokes, whether or not
a wrapper reports it. `report` settles inside the event, so that queued frame finds nothing owed and
stands down.

That still leaves `report` doing work the runtime cannot. A change the runtime is handed no event for is
settled only by the pass that follows it: a change a timer or a caller makes with no event in hand, and a
drop, which Swing dispatches without offering it to toolkit listeners. So report a discrete interaction
wherever the component can, and reach for `observed` where one of the two reasons above applies.

A mirror reports through a node, and `declare` states that for the declaration it settles - so a
component built the way above needs nothing more. A component that settles a mirror some other way -
applying two declarations the widget resolves together, or reading back a property no declaration is
written through - applies it itself with `applyMirror(mirror)` in the `update` block, and makes the write
inside `mirror.settle`. A mirror that reports without either fails at the first change rather than
quietly taking the slower path.

The pieces belong to one node. Remember the `MirrorState` in the component's own body, beside the
`SwingNode` it settles, and call `declare` exactly once per pass: what a declaration is compared against
lives on the mirror rather than in the composition, so a mirror shared between nodes, or remembered above
the node it settles, goes on answering for a widget that is no longer there - and the widget built in its
place keeps its constructor's value instead of the standing declaration. `declare` also makes one `set`
call, so a `declare` inside a conditional shifts every later slot in the `update` block, exactly as a
conditional `set` does.

### A worked example

This is the shape for a widget whose change arrives and reports on one channel - a checkbox outside a
button group, `checked` in and `onCheckedChange` out over the two-way `isSelected` property:

import org.jetbrains.compose.swing.modifier.listener.actionListener

    val mirror = rememberMirrorState(checked)
    SwingNode(
        factory = { JCheckBox() },
        // The box publishes its new value for every toggle, its own and the user's alike.
        // `report` tells which is which by value - a toggle that lands on the declaration is the
        // declaration arriving, not a change - and settles the composition once the caller has had
        // it. The lambda is read when the event fires, so writing it here holds nothing
        // across compositions.
        modifier =
            modifier.actionListener { event ->
                mirror.report((event.source as JCheckBox).isSelected, onCheckedChange)
            },
        update = {
            set(text) { this.text = it }
            // Settles `checked` against the box whenever either side has changed, rather than only when
            // this pass's declaration differs from the last one.
            declare(checked, mirror, JCheckBox::isSelected, JCheckBox::setSelected)
        },
    )
}
```

<!--- KNIT example-custom-state-01.kt -->

### The component is fully controlled

Once a property is bound this way, the component is **fully controlled**: a change the caller does not
adopt never stands. Clicking the box flips `isSelected` immediately - that click is a real change, and
the box shows it - and `report` hands it to `onCheckedChange` as news. But if `onCheckedChange` does
not feed a new `checked` back in, the next pass finds the box holding a value other than the one this
composition still declares, and writes the declaration back over it, undoing the click. Adopting the
change in the callback - folding it into whatever state `checked` is computed from - is what makes it
stick.

### `onSettled` - when the widget answers a write with something else

`declare` takes an optional `onSettled` block, invoked when the widget does not end up holding what was
asked for - a value clamped to a model's range, an index or path a widget no longer has. It receives
whatever the widget actually settled on, called only after the widget has been left alone, so what it
reports is final. It defaults to doing nothing because most two-way properties admit every value the
composition could declare for them - a checkbox is either selected or not, and both values always take -
so there is nothing to report.

## The applicability boundary: not every user-movable property is `declare`'s

`declare` re-asserts the declaration on every pass. That is right for a property that holds a genuine
value - a selection index, a selected path, a checkbox's state - and wrong for one whose declared value is
a sentinel or a request rather than a value to hold, or one the widget only resolves later, at layout
time.

`JSplitPane`'s `dividerLocation` is the case in point: a negative offset does not mean "the divider sits at
that offset", it means "derive the divider's position from the two sides' preferred sizes" - a derivation
that only happens once the pane is laid out. Re-asserting such a declaration on every pass would fight the
user on every single recomposition, not only the one after they moved the divider.

For a property like this, apply on change instead of declaring it: compare against the widget's current
value yourself, and make the write inside `mirror.write { }` so it still marks itself as the wrapper's
own and the listener does not mistake it for a change to report:

```kotlin
set(dividerLocation) { location ->
    if (this.dividerLocation != location) {
        mirror.write { this.dividerLocation = location }
    }
}
```

<!--- CLEAR -->

The `mirror` here is the same `MirrorState` its listener calls `observed` on - `write` is what lets the
two share one mirror without fighting the user the way re-asserting the declaration on every pass would.

## Taking a value in and reporting a change out

A property with two writers reaches your component as a pair: the value in, and the callback that
reports the user's own change out. The two are one channel, and a component takes both or neither. A
widget the user can move, declared without the callback that reports the move, is frozen: it is fully
controlled, so every click is settled back onto a declaration nothing feeds a new value in for. A
declared state parameter is required for exactly this reason, and the callback is the other half of
the same requirement - never a convenience to default.

Which shape the pair takes follows from who owns the value -
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md#shapes-for-state-the-user-can-change) says which state is which.
There are four cases:

1. **Declared** - the composition owns the value. The parameter is required, and the callback that
   reports the user moving it is required immediately after it: `CheckBox`'s `checked` and
   `onCheckedChange`, `Slider`'s `value` and `onValueChange`, `TabbedPane`'s `selectedIndex` and
   `onSelectedIndexChange`.
2. **Undeclared** - the widget owns it. The parameter is nullable, defaults to `null`, and its callback
   is optional beside it: `ListBox`'s `selectedIndices` and `onSelectionChange`, `Tree`'s
   `expandedPaths` and `onExpansionChange`.
3. **Model-owned** - the caller hands the widget a model, which takes the value out of the composition
   altogether. The model holds it, the widget renders whatever it holds, and nothing is declared over it,
   so there is no half for a callback to pair with. The callback is then only a report of where the model
   has got to, and stays optional after `modifier`, as `Slider(model, ...)` and `ComboBox(model, ...)`
   keep it.
4. **Defaulted to a real value** - `selected: Boolean = false` - is none of the three, and is the defect
   the first three rule out. It declares a value the user can move while letting the caller leave out the
   callback that reports the move, and the widget is then frozen as above.

Where each pair sits is forced rather than preferred. The Compose lint check the build runs takes
parameters without defaults first, then `modifier`, then parameters with defaults, then optionally one
trailing function type without a default: a required pair therefore leads, ahead of `modifier`, and a
defaulted pair follows it. Written the other way round, neither builds. Undeclared state in particular
cannot lead: it carries a default, so ahead of `modifier` it fails the lint, and in the raw-listener
overload it would push the listener behind a defaulted parameter and force every caller to name it.

```kotlin
// Declared: `checked` is the composition's, so it and its callback lead.
@Composable
public fun CheckBox(
    text: @Nls String,
    checked: Boolean,
    onCheckedChange: (Boolean) -> Unit,
    modifier: SwingModifier = SwingModifier,
)

// Undeclared: leaving `selectedIndices` out leaves the selection to the list, and the pair follows
// `modifier`.
@Composable
public fun <T> ListBox(
    items: List<T>,
    modifier: SwingModifier = SwingModifier,
    selectedIndices: Set<Int>? = null,
    onSelectionChange: (Set<Int>) -> Unit = {},
    // ...
)

// Model-owned: the model holds the value, so the callback only reports it.
@Composable
public fun Slider(
    model: BoundedRangeModel,
    modifier: SwingModifier = SwingModifier,
    onValueChange: (Int) -> Unit = {},
    // ...
)
```

<!--- CLEAR -->

What makes state undeclared is the default, not the type. `ComboBox`'s `selectedItem: T?` is required:
`null` there is a declared selection of nothing, which the composition owns like any other value.

A sentinel default is a different thing from a real value. `SplitPane`'s `dividerLocation: Int = -1`
and `ToolBar`'s `floating: Boolean = false` are what the bare widget holds: `JSplitPane` reports `-1`
until a location is set, and `JToolBar` keeps no floating property of its own - the look and feel's
`BasicToolBarUI` holds it, and a bar not yet in a window has nothing to float beside. Matching the
widget outranks writing the sentinel as `null`, and boxing an `Int` or a `Boolean` for it would buy
nothing. Carrying a default, both sit after `modifier` beside their optional callback. The divider's
sentinel is also a request the pane resolves at layout time rather than a value to re-assert, which is
the applicability boundary above; a tool bar's `floating` is a value, and is settled every pass.

A raw-listener overload puts its required listener where the lambda overload puts its required
callback: `CheckBox(text, checked, actionListener, modifier = ...)` beside `CheckBox(text, checked,
onCheckedChange, modifier = ...)`. Where the state is undeclared the listener still leads - it has no
default - while the nullable state stays after `modifier`: `ListBox(items, listSelectionListener,
modifier = ..., selectedIndices = null, ...)`. That is the one place the two overloads legitimately
differ.

A component with several channels leads with the primary one, and the rest follow `modifier`. `Table`'s
raw-listener overload leads with `listSelectionListener` and takes `rowSorterListener:
RowSorterListener? = null` after `modifier`; `Tree`'s does the same with `treeExpansionListener` and
`treeWillExpandListener`.

A callback reporting something other than a declared value - a settle, a commit, a validity flag, a
veto - is supplementary the same way: optional, after `modifier`, as `Slider`'s `onValueSettled`,
`ComboBox`'s `onValueCommit`, `FormattedTextField`'s `onEditValidChange` and `Tree`'s `onWillExpand`
are.

A callback that reports an action rather than a state - `Button`'s `onClick`, `MenuItem`'s `onClick`,
`Tray`'s `onAction`, `EditorPane`'s `onLinkActivate`, `InternalFrame`'s `onClose` - pairs with nothing,
and is still required: a button whose click goes nowhere is as inert as a checkbox that cannot be
ticked. `onClose` is the sharpest case: an internal frame's close control is controlled - the frame
never closes itself - so a frame declared without `onClose` shows a close button that does nothing.
Being required, an action callback leads, in the slot the raw-listener overload gives its listener:
`Button(text, onClick, modifier = ...)` beside `Button(text, actionListener, modifier = ...)`.

The trailing position never holds a callback. It is the slot the caller fills with what the component
shows: a composable content block, as `TabbedPane` and `SplitPane` trail with; a scope builder, as
`RadioGroup` does; or a draw block - `Canvas(modifier = ..., onDraw)` trails with `onDraw` because
what it paints is content, not a report. A raw listener cannot trail anyway - the lint's trailing
exemption is for a function type, and a SAM interface such as `ActionListener` is not one, so a
required listener behind `modifier` fails the lint - and holding the lambda overload to the same rule
is what keeps the two overloads in step. A modifier is the exception: it has no content slot to
reserve, so `SwingModifier.onKeyStroke { }` and `SwingModifier.actionListener { }` keep the trailing
lambda, the way `Modifier.clickable { }` does.

Compose Multiplatform's own surface is the cross-check, and it is not uniform. Material3 leads with
the required callback whether or not a content slot exists to claim the trailing position -
`Checkbox(checked, onCheckedChange, modifier = ...)` and `DropdownMenuItem(text, onClick, modifier =
...)` have none and still lead - and that is the half this library follows. Its desktop
`MenuScope.Item` takes `onClick` last instead; `MenuItem` here follows `DropdownMenuItem`. Its `Tray`
defaults `onAction` to `{}`; `Tray` here requires it, by the rule for action callbacks.

A callback a sibling flag gates stays optional. A table column's `onCellEdit` and a tree's `onNodeEdit`
are only reachable while `isEditable` is `true`, and `isEditable` defaults to `false`. Requiring them
would make every read-only column and every read-only tree declare a handler that is never called. The
pairing is real but conditional, the signature cannot express it, and a runtime check is not worth
closing it.

## Writing a state holder

A declared value with a callback beside it does not carry every kind of state. Where it does not - a
group of values that move together, a value the component reports and no caller could declare, a model
the widget already owns - the shape is a hoistable state holder: an `XState` class the caller keeps
next to their own state, with a `rememberXState` factory beside it.
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md#shapes-for-state-the-user-can-change) says which state takes which
shape; what follows is what building one takes.

### The model keeps the value, the holder makes it observable

A widget with a model of its own - a spinner's `SpinnerModel`, a text component's `Document`, a range
widget's `BoundedRangeModel` - already holds the value and already announces every change to it. A
holder over such a widget owns that model and hands it to the widget, and what it adds is the one thing
the model does not have: a reader composing against it recomposes when the value changes. So the holder
keeps no second copy of the value to write and reconcile; it keeps whatever makes a read of the model
into a snapshot read.

Two shapes do that, and what the value costs to produce decides which:

- **A mirror** - a snapshot-state field refreshed from the model's own change notification, read
  straight back out by the property's getter. `ScrollState` mirrors a viewport's position and its
  metrics as six ints this way. Reach for it wherever the value is small and fixed-size, which is
  nearly always.
- **A generation counter** - a single `mutableIntStateOf` the change listener bumps and nothing else
  reads for its own sake. Each derived property reads the counter first, which registers the
  subscription, then computes its answer from the model. `DocumentState` carries `text`, `canUndo` and
  `canRedo` this way: a keystroke bumps one int and invalidates whoever was reading, and the document
  is walked only when a caller actually asks for its content. Reach for it where mirroring would
  materialize something large on every change whether or not anything reads it - the whole text of a
  document is the case in point - and pay for the extra indirection only there.

The two are not exclusive within one holder. `DocumentState` runs a counter for its text and mirrors
its selection directly, because a selection is a small fixed-size value and re-deriving it would buy
nothing.

### What the widget settles on is what the holder reports

A write through a holder is a request, and the model answers it. A value can come back clamped to a
bound, snapped to a step, refused outright; a caret offset past the end of a document lands at the end.
Read the value back out of the model after the write and mirror **that**, never the value that was
asked for - the `observedValue = model.value` above rather than `observedValue = value`. A holder that
mirrors the request claims a value the widget does not have, and nothing later corrects it: a model
settles some writes without announcing anything for the change listener to carry.

Where the value the model hands back is an object the model steps **in place** - the same instance,
mutated - a structurally compared mirror cannot tell that from no change at all, and every reader
stands on a value the model has already stepped past. Declare the mirror
`mutableStateOf(model.value, neverEqualPolicy())` there and every refresh invalidates its readers
regardless of what they would have compared to. A holder over a model the caller wrote has to reckon
with that, since nothing constrains what such a model hands back or whether it steps that value in
place. What keeps the policy from recomposing on every pass is the model and the guard
together: a refresh only ever follows a change the model announced, and a model announces the changes
it actually made, while the guard on the setter keeps the holder from pushing a value the model already
holds and provoking an announcement of its own. Reach for the policy and you need the guard with it.

### Constraints are declarations, and are written onto the model

What the model holds is the holder's; what bounds it stays something the caller declares. A range's
`min` and `max`, a spinner's step, the items a list model steps through, are parameters of the
`remember` factory, and a later change to one of them is written onto the live model from a
`SideEffect` - as `rememberRangeState` above does - rather than by building a new model. Rebuilding
would take the current value and every listener with it, the widget's and the holder's own, and hand
the caller a holder driving a model nothing renders.

That is also what the two `remember` calls in the factory say. A model the holder owns is remembered
without keys, so a later declaration reaches it through the `SideEffect` and never rebuilds it. A model
the caller supplies is remembered on its identity instead - `remember(model) { RangeState(model) }` -
so handing over a different model builds the holder that drives it, and the widget switches to
rendering it.

Writing a constraint is not writing the value, and what a tightened bound does to a value already
outside it is the model's business rather than the holder's: write the bound and let the model answer.
A `SpinnerNumberModel` leaves the value where it is, outside the range that was just declared, while a
`DefaultBoundedRangeModel` pulls it into range and announces the change. Either way the mirror is
refreshed from what the model announced, so the holder reports whichever happened - which is the same
rule as for a write, arriving from the other side.

### The holder gives back what it took

A holder listening to a model is listening to something that can outlive it. A document or model the
caller supplied is the caller's, and it stays alive - and reachable - after the holder that listened to
it is gone. Implement `RememberObserver`: attach in `onRemembered`, detach in `onForgotten`, and
delegate `onAbandoned` to `onForgotten`, so a holder created for a composition that never applied lets
go too.
Without it a discarded holder stays reachable from the live model and its listener keeps firing, on
state nothing reads any more. A listener attached in `onRemembered` also wants the value re-read
there, since the model is free to change between the holder being constructed and being remembered.

Reaching the component that renders the holder is a separate binding, and `set` is the wrong channel
for it: the binding has to end exactly when the component stops rendering the holder - the node
released or deactivated - and that is a modifier node's lifecycle. Bind through an element of your own,
in the registering shape of *Writing a custom property element* in
[`CUSTOM-MODIFIERS.md`](CUSTOM-MODIFIERS.md): attach the holder in `update`, release it in `onDetach`,
and compare the element by identity so a holder that only looks like the bound one is still a
different holder to give the component over to.

### Only the inputs are state

A holder keeps snapshot state for what it is told - the mirrored value, the metrics read off the
widget - and for nothing that follows from those. Anything computable from them is computed when it is
read. A getter that reads the state it derives from subscribes its reader to that state on every read,
so it can neither go stale nor need keeping in sync; a second field written from the setter that fed
the first can do both, and a reader of it never learns that its inputs changed. `ScrollState`'s `maxX` is
that getter - the view's width less the visible extent, floored at zero - and it follows the pane with
no third field to invalidate.

`derivedStateOf` earns its place where the derivation **narrows**: where many changes of the inputs
produce few changes of the result. `ScrollState`'s `canScrollForwardY` is `y < maxY` over values that
move on every scrolled pixel and every resize, while the answer itself changes only when an end is
reached or left. Wrapping it caches the result and holds its readers still until the answer changes,
so a toolbar button that only wants to know whether there is anywhere left to scroll is not recomposed
by scrolling. Where the result changes about as often as its inputs do, or where the property only
re-exposes state under another name - a `bounds` over `x`, `y`, `width` and `height` - a plain getter
is right, and `derivedStateOf` would buy a cache and a subscription for nothing.
